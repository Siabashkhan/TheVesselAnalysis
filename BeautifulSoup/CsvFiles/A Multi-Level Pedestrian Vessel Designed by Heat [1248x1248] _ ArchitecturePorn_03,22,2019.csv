Hooly shit fuck that
$200 MILLION????
are you shitting me?
I mean its not the worst thing I've ever seen. But $200 MILLION? For That? Really?
I could think of so many amazing hitngs to do with $200 MILLION
"It makes sense. NYC is costly. Combine this labor, transportation, and administration, it makes sense."
chicago bean cost $23M and is awesome and way better than this boring thing

A giant metal ball would be better than this wasps-nest-looking monstrosity.
Easy solution: only take nude selfies while in there.
"If you're a dude, helicopter your dick for added action shots"
So not only does this thing look like its straight out of a sci-fi dystopia...
It is a public place - no expectation of privacy.
I don't mind if they used a photo or video I uploaded but giving up personal details such as my name or even using my face (which would be more in detail and in center than me just passing by) in a video or photo I uploaded is quite wrong. Hudson Yards want to make a visitor center there and this policy would hurt this endeavor. They should alter it.
"We were walking by it (we had just exited The High Line) about a week ago (before it opened) and were approached by a man in a hard hat. We chatted for about five minutes and he asked us what we thought about it and what came to mind. We told him we liked it and that MC Escher came to mind. As soon as he heard Escher he lit up and said ‘yes, exactly, that’s it!’"
"Eventually he told us that it was his project and that he was the lead architect (his name was Lawrence), and that he was talking to people to get feedback for his team back in London."
It was pretty cool to meet the lead architect of the ‘Vessel’ completely by accident!
He shoulda hooked you up woth free tickets
"Tickets are free, at least when I went"
He did design it but he also isn't actually a licensed architect

Why did they build a giant wastepaper basket and a miniature Dubai in new york?

oof
hate to say it but that writer has a lot of good points
"Lol, some guy complaining about how NYC is not what it was."
Did you read the article?
"The NYT had a great, scathing review of Hudson Yards.  As for this wastebasket - I reserved judgment until I saw it in person ... I'd see pix like this, with it squeezed up against much larger buildings, but I reserved judgment... then I saw it.  Such a joke, IMHO - if this were in the middle of Central Park or down at the tip of the Battery, it might be different, but sitting squat under buildings several times its height just underscores that this wastebasket is throwaway ""art"" to satisfy city planners - not to actually beautify the city."

it looks like a toy for the surrounding buildings
why   not
"Ugly, unsympathetic, and expensive?"
"do you think they care? all this debate and argument is free press for the city, and actually increases the chance that people will go, whether they like it or not. no city REALLY considers anything important when making moves like this ."
no city REALLY considers anything important when making moves like this
I guess you've never been to Europe.
This is the best description I've seen of this thing. Thank you so much!
"Pretty sure Dubai came after NYC, not the opposite. Skyscrapers and glass buildings existed in NYC long before Dubai. And the aesthetical value of The Vessel is dependent on ones perspective."
It seems like it's just art + sightseeing platform? (wiki)
"It's a staircase to nowhere is what it is. They could have done some amazing things with actual walkways but instead made this, because it's higher and more impressive and no one will go on it because there's hardly a view to look at and no place to go except back down."
A place for exercise and viewpoints in a populous area is useless?
For the amount of effort and money poured into this? Frighteningly so.

"It's an example of extremely object-based design in an urban design context. You could copy paste this anywhere in the world and it would fit in just as much as it does here (except the top of some hill overlooking some unique scenery). Not because of some universal utility but because of universal lack of engagement with it's surroundings. ""I made this object pretty and now everyone will like and interact with it"" is a sculptural attitude, not an urban one. The form itself still feels like the classic case of ""boy that rendering looks pretty""."
Sorry to be negative but it's just so much worse for an urban context than thousands of examples. I look forward to seeing how clean the top is and who has to bring a hose up there once someone pukes.
It's art.  It's just not good art.

So we have a convoluted stairway to nowhere funded by taxpayers but no functioning subway system. Yay!
"What? We have functioning subway system. Also, what kind of poor comparison is this. I hope you don't say NASA should be defunded."
Do you have any concept of the MTA right now? It’s in horrendous shape.
"Haven't been to NYC in a while, but when I frequently visited NYC, I found it pretty good. Hell, I used it to come from NJ. What type of ""horrendous shape"" are you referring to?"
""
"Alright, you made your point. But 1) this issue is also common with Amtrak so hence I thought it was fine 2) Repairs are being made and the cost is $836 million and they have poured $333 million. This repair will help the system for several years, if not a decade 3) New York State Gov received $76 billion or $76,000 million. The cost of repairs is 1.1% of 2018 tax revenue. This doesn't include the revenues MTA receives from tickets. In order words, while your point is kinda true that the subway needs to be improved, this issue isn't a rarity in US. Though, subways are only useful in cities. Also, the cost is extremely minute compared to the revenue NY state gov receives in a year alone. This demonstrates NY government's poor management skills instead of financial ""burden"" due to this showpiece. Also, they are attempting to enhance NYC for tourism, like Dubai. This would attract both domestic and international tourism."
Thanks I hate it
Read the fine print on their tickets. They assert copyrights to any photos taken on/in/from there.
"I can assert that I own the world, here's my lawyer and legal briefs. Doesnt make it true or anything that holds up in court."
"Snark is all good and well, but they put it in contract form a part of the ticket sale."
There is such a thing as an unenforceable provision.
"I'd love to see it in court, for sure."
Death Star meets pinecone
I heard Heatherwick speak about this project about 2 years ago and he was really passionate and excited about it. He almost had me convinced about the concept. But seeing it in execution.. I'm just not sure.
Add to that the environmental concerns about rising sea levels re: Hudson Yards..
"I was there on Wednesday, it's really cool.  Didn't go up it because I don't like heights that much."
Interestingly I think the real estate company is claiming rights to all images taken of the structure.
This is a godforsaken eyesore and a slight upon the core ideals of environmental design.
Looks like something from a street meat cart.
"Hudson yards is a mess. The basket is ok as art/ sculpture/ attraction, and that cool performance space with the moving roof is cool."
"Overall its just a poorly considered collection of trophy buildings, with insufficient thought to integrating it with the city"
Just a property developer’s wet dream.
There was a really good NY Times article recently that summed it all up really well.
https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/14/arts/design/hudson-yards-nyc.html
The interesting thing though is that a lot of these similar criticisms where levied at the original WTC when it first opened way back in the 70s.
"That was also a different era though, and didn't have as much of the sting of extreme wealth inequality, hyper-commercialization, and the pretentious facade of social media as guiding lights for the development. It was really just two big office buildings."
"I feel like if Hudson Yards had been two big office buildings with some residential (without the extreme price tag, and with affordable housing included) and a nice art installation by a local artist instead of this Heatherwick trash then there would have been basically zero pushback."
"But it wasn't, because that's the hyper-capitalistic, hyper-corporatist era we live in. Bloomberg is an ass for foisting this upon the city and turning Manhattan into even more of a Disneyworldesque plastic city than it's been over the past decade."
"I didn’t really get why this particular structure was so hated, but seeing it from this angle really makes it look unpleasant."
This (and most of Hudson Yards) is very arrogant
"Empty on the inside, just like its concept."
"The city needs art but for what it is, basically a giant Instagram trap, it seems like we could have spent the money better. Like a public center for young or emerging artists and art education?"
This looks like a knockoff version of the Longaberger Basket Building.
From now on nobody can accuse New York of being snobbish.
