"The Vessel was shown multiple times during the ""Too Much Birthday"" episode. As a lot of New Yorker's know, there is a weird energy surrounding the Vessel because a lot of people have committed suicide off of it since it opened. The last scene, Ken was on the rooftop and I think the intent was to make the audience think he was suicidal. Thoughts?"
"I mean, Vessel or no Vessel, the intention is clearly to show Ken on the edge, just like in the second season episode with the shooter. Ken staring off a balcony definitely signifies a low point."
"What’s interesting is that last season, after his low point, things kind of turned around for him when he became instrumental in the Pierce deal and when he met Naomi."
"Though as a native New Yorker, Ken definitely has that weird Vessel /Hudson Yards energy. I can’t quite put it into words but it’s something about the quietly desperate finance/tech bro spouting meaningless words and seeking meaningless status symbols while thinking their money makes them king of the universe"
There is no soul on the Hudson Yards. Just a bunch of hollow buildings. Terrible energy.
"Exactly. No soul, just a lot of hollowness that makes an obvious attempt at “hipness” and “coolness” but reveals just how out of step it really is. Fits Ken to a T"
The place is as desolate as the buildings are tall.
"Agree with your comment. I’ve always thought the writers have hinted at this in various ways. Word on the street is the final S3 ep is going to be very shocking and dark.  Ugh, even though I love to hate them all, I don’t want any to leave the show like that."
"I don’t know anything about NY, but I did think it was odd that on the building the party is in above the door it says “The Notorious Ken Ready to Die”  I mean sure he was gonna be Jesus or whatever, but lots of hints."
Isn't that like an ode to Biggie since he's like a big hip hop fan
"My initial thought was the Vessel is kind of the same shape as a uterus, which sort of fits into the theme of guests walking through Kendall’s mother’s vajayjay."
