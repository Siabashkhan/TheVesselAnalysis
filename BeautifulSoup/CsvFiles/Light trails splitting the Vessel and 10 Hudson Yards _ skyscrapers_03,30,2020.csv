How could anyone dislike this work of art
"Can't speak for all New Yorkers, but it seems like most people from NY don't like the Vessel because it's a tourist spot.  I agree though, it's a pretty neat piece of architecture."
"Just like B1M said one day the Bessel will seen as the architectural marvel that it is. It’s like saying the Empire State Building is a waste of space because it’s a tourist trap. In my opinion it shows the artistic spirit of the city, because it’s only there to allow to see the buildings around you. It’s piece of art made to admire other pieces of art."
"Completed in 2016, 10 Hudson Yards was the first Hudson Yards tower to be finished.  10 Hudson Yards stands at 878 feet (268 m), which would be a respectable height in any other skyline, but it is somewhat dwarfed by the surrounding skyscrapers (with 30 Hudson Yards at 1,269 feet - 387 m).  Only 55 Hudson Yards is shorter, at 778 feet (237 m)."
