"Ah yes, Suicide Tower, coming together so nicely."
"We had this problem at Baruch college. As soon as the new atrium was built, people started jumping off. So the management put in place ""people catcher"" nets that stretched over the shaft every other floor or so."
"Tbf, the entire building is a deathtrap. The curvature of the Vertical Campus means that part of the entrance needs to be taped off when it snows because ice rolls right off the side of the building. That shit will absolutely fucking annihilate anyone trying to enter on 24th St."
The scaffoldings will never come off are they? Craziness.
except for the vip parties - only the wealthy or invited will be able to have the full experience of the sculpture.
It looks like it belongs in Megacity One...
Same problem at NYU Bobst. Design looks better now though.
Really? I thought it was shit when the barrier was first put up.
"We had something similar when I went to school in Rochester, except it was snow blocking the exits."
"Probably helps with the noise levels also, but students just drag over a table and chair. That's what happened about 8 years ago IIRC."
I remember they had those floors that looks like arrow pointing up when viewed from top
Spent most of my time in the lower levels when I went to school there
even if just for the aesthetics I wish there was another elevator
I sorta wish there wasn’t one at all.
Surprised there isn't with ADA.
"I think because its not a ""functional"" building and is classified as ""sculpture"" its not totally subject to ADA ... I'm not totally sure of that though."
The only reason it has an elevator is because of the ADA.

So many incoming ig pics
Everyone’s an artist these days. And I say that in the meanest possible way.
Just let people be happy man
"No, this is New York City"
"The issue is that they’re ruining my happiness. I spent New Years on Venice Beach in LA, running on the boardwalk every day, biking around. Just enjoying life."
"And there were multiple times where someone with a selfie stick on a bike would accidentally hit me, or when I found a great quiet place and it suddenly became a photo shoot for 10 loud people."
The only time I have now is super early in the morning. I’m old. Hi.
There's nothing worse than people who run or bike in tourist hotspots and expect the seas to part for them.
It's like you can't even get in a good jog around Times Square anymore!
Is Venice still really bad with homeless and gangs?
All of California is really bad with homeless. The gang stuff less so.
I went to Iceland in 2016.  I asked a shopkeeper what he thought of all the tourism and he just made a face.
No. people should be told when they do terrible things.
Can’t wait to see how Tom Cruise free falls down this without a stunt man in the inevitable Mission:Impossible scene that takes place here.
"Will it be an ""attraction"" with paying tickets? Or a public park?"
I can't imagine they'll charge for it.
Like stairs you say? We've got em!
""
Stairs! Stairs! Only 15 dollars to climb the magnificent stair sculpture!
""
Yeah it’s public.
How long before its covered in fencing to stop people from jumping? Wouldnt be a problem if we had affordable suicide booths.
Unpopular opinion i guess but i think that building is ugly as fuck both inside and outside. Just a huge eyesore to me in the middle of these skyscrapers.
This is not an unpopular opinion on this sub
Inspired by the feeling you get when you're stuck behind a slow-moving group of people going up a narrow staircase.
Damn this thing must have been such a nightmare to have to fabricate and assemble. Just looking at that sideways elevator gives my $$$$ in my eyes.
oh yes... my old enemy... stairs
And those with knees will agree with you.
It's going to be so burdensome to clean this. And will the city prevent this from being filled with homeless people? Every homeless gets their own silo separated by a staircase.
What's the point of this? Looks like something they designed for fun but then actually built it for whatever reason
"Its an interactive sculpture.  And again the deep deep down ""core"" reason it was built is part of the public amenities portion of the permit to build the whole Hudson Yards complex of buildings in the first place.  Stephen Ross the founder of Related Companies (the property developer behind the Hudson Yards project) wanted a signature feature in the public space in Hudson Park and hired British architect Thomas Heatherwick to design it for him."
"It's an ""interactive sculpture""? By that logic any set of stairs is an interactive sculpture, doesn't seem very creative, and the reason it was built was because the developer had a bunch of extra money to blow on this? Glad they have that kind of disposable funds while the rest of the city struggles to afford rent"
Thomas Heatherwick took inspiration from Hindu Step-wells in Gujarat and Rajahstan in India ...

And the reason Ross spent 180 million dollars on Vessel was so that his entire 16 billion dollar property project could go ahead.
So it wouldn’t have been allowed without the vessel or some other comparable stuff?
"The permit to construct Hudson Yards is a very complex series of documents relating to a lot of things, but yeah one of the obligations that Related Companies had was to create new public spaces for both visitors and locals alike ..."
dope
I'm surprised at how quick they are completing this. I recall it being announced on the news not so long ago.
"because unlike the twin towers replacement, there isn't millions of dollars to be made by dragging their feet"
I'm still waiting to be able to get tickets for it.
Yup. Signed up as well.
MC Escher just came in his pants.
Stairception.
Looks like Darth Vader would live there.
"They knew they could build it and so they would, but they never stopped to think if they should."
