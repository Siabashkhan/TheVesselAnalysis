"I‚Äôm a tour guide (sorry!!) and people look bored to death during my Hudson Yards tour, even when I take them to the Highline. I really am trying my best to be engaging but there‚Äôs not much to work with. Are there any interesting facts about the neighborhood that you know about? (Other than the Vessel being closed because people kept jumping off of it)."
"Update: thank you everyone for your suggestions! A few things that were mentioned I do talk about on the tour, but even so I really appreciated the articles and videos that went a bit more in depth. I incorporated a few of the things mentioned here (various film shoots, the EB5 scam) today and people liked it, and I got more tips. People still left part way through though and that might just be because the neighborhood has no rizzüò£"
"The construction of the site itself is very interesting. It's basically all a bridge with a train yard below, the land above had to be constructed in addition to buildings. The skyscrapers can't use regular foundations because of that train yard, instead they're supported by hundreds of strategically placed tubes which were positioned between the tracks, drilled down to bedrock and filled with concrete. Huge steel girders sit on top of that to form the platform to build everything else on."
"There's the original 2012 NYC olympics bid, a huge west side stadium built on that site was the centerpiece of the NYC bid. When that bid was lost to London, it was pitched as a stadium for the Jets, which basically everyone hated."
"There are still plans for Hudson Yards phase 2 (yes, HY is only half done), how that's now in doubt because of future demand for office space."
"The Shed's architecture, it's designed to roll open and closed on train tracks, so it's built to be light weight. To do this, they built a steel frame and covered it in a form of Teflon instead of glass to save weight."
"The HY Subway station is 10 stories deep, one of the deeper ones in NYC. When it opened in 2015 it was the first new station in over 25 years. The station was originally planned to include platform doors which would open only when a train was in the station to prevent people accessing or falling onto the tracks. That was never built. The turnstiles are also different than other stations because the MTA's stock of spare turnstiles was destroyed in hurricane Sandy."
"Not technically HY, but across the street is 5 Manhattan West (450 W 33rd), which was converted to a modern looking glass building by gutting a (cool looking) old brutalist building and refacing it with glass. The building once housed the Skyrink, an indoor public ice skating rink on the 16th (top) floor, overlooking the city. When DoubleClick moved in there in the late 90s (prior to Google buying them), all the plumbing for the rink and a Zamboni were still in the space."
Fantastic writeup.
"Only thing that is missing is the part where financing was secured by establishing the entire development as Distressed Urban Area, full of poor people. But there was literally no one living in that area."
No problem. They created a new district that included all public housing in (drumroll) East Harlem.
""
What the fuck
What district is that?
Corruption?! In New York City?!
I'm so fucking tired of these corrupt motherfuckers here
"I'm shocked, shocked, to find that corruption is going on in here."
This map explains a lot of why I had to haul my ass all the way the Hudson yards to vote for some reason. I live by Grand Central. Nowhere near that. This very much angers me.
""
"Wow, I did not know this. Thanks!"
This is absolutely what I always think about when I think of Hudson Yards
IIRC the inclusion of central park also drastically reduced the average income per sq mile because...well nobody lives there. But maybe that was a myth
Wasn‚Äôt that done as a complex transfer of credits from Frederick Douglas down to the site?
The entirety of Central Park making the map is a nice bonus.
"This is the story to tell. It‚Äôs a little hard to put together, but if told well is a really important AND interesting piece of recent history that really could help people understand New York better."
"Also,don‚Äôt forget about the kebab suicides!"
"Adding to this, they have to pump coolant through the platform so heat from the trainyard underneath doesn't kill the trees. Congratulations, you've created plantings that actually contribute to climate change."
""
I know it‚Äôs a B1M video before I even click it!
B1M makes fantastic videos.
Thanks for this video!!
Damn dawg you should be a tour guide lmao
"All of these things are true, yet none change the fact that Hudson Yards feels pointless and fake at best and actively malevolent at worst. People look bored to death because the vibes are carcinogenic. It‚Äôs the world‚Äôs gaudiest suicide platform combined with NYC‚Äôs tenth (?) best art museum (I‚Äôm being generous) and a generic luxury shopping mall so devoid of personality it pales in comparison to any of the recently built airport terminals in this city. ü§¢ü§Æ"
The Suicide Shawarma is the best worst best nickname for the Vessel
The trampoline
"Omg I always called it the suicide kebab, hoooooow did I miss something this obvious"
"I happen to be in the Hudson Yards area fairly often, and sometimes go into the mall just to gawk at the stupidly expensive stuff. The NFT store is really weird."
There‚Äôs an nft store?? Jesus
""
Aaahahahahah
"‚ÄòLittle Dubai‚Äô, a friend calls it"
"Lol, this is how I too imagine Dubai."
"Wait, what art museum is there?"
"idk about an art museum, but the Shed is there which is more like rentable art space for galleries, small performances, conferences, or whatever the fuck. But it always looks bleak and boring. One of the bartenders in the bar downstairs was nice to me though, so that's a bonus."
Frieze was amazing in there
The Shed
Definitely not an art museum.
How isn't it?
It‚Äôs an art center. They don‚Äôt consider themselves a museum and are not a collecting institution.
So what? Don‚Äôt be pedantic. The New Museum and PS1 aren‚Äôt collecting institutions either. But you can call it a kunsthalle or whatever tf you want if it makes you feel better.
Not being pedantic bro. They don‚Äôt identify as a museum. They are not a museum. New museum calls itself a museum. And you can be damn sure they both have collections. Wuff.
"Lmao I fucking worked at one of those places, ‚Äúbro,‚Äù I think I know what I‚Äôm talking about."
lol pretty accurate
It was far more interesting when it was still industrial.
I like how you're dong this person's job for them
"No, not everyone hated the idea of a West Side New York Jets stadium. Sheldon Silver was a crook and undoubtedly took money under the table from James Dolan and Cablevision to squash the deal. Such a shame he died in disgrace."
"Went into this rabbit hole seeing Cablevision, used to work for them."
"Yeah, tbh a stadium over there would've been kind of awesome. 8-ish football games per year plus outdoor concerts in the warmer months and other events. Could've been really nice actually."
"When that bid was lost to London, it was pitched as a stadium for the Jets, which basically everyone hated."
"It was not universally hated. Many sports fans wanted a Manhattan stadium, so when it favored the Jets, other teams fans jumped off the bandwagon. Bloomberg hated the idea anyway and continued the smear campaign"
"Otherwise, great write up"
Bloomberg hated the idea anyway and continued the smear campaign
Wasn't it Bloomberg's idea?
Hudson Yards Phase 2 was supposed to be residential rather than commercial so I don‚Äôt think the downturn in commercial demand is affecting it
Yes. the affordable housing is coming.. always coming
lmaooooo your username
üòé
"When I went to the HY station first time, as a acrophobic, I almost peed my pants seeing how high the escalator are. After the subway dropped me off at the station, I was literally wandering at the station for 15-20 minutes looking for some other exit. Finally gave up and got on the escalator in the middle of a big group."
"The new Penn Station escalators are probably longer and steeper, but I am not sure."
I saw two people fall down the escalators at the Hudson Yards station from mid point and roll all the way down. One went down and dragged the other with them. It was jarring. Hold on to the rail tight!!!
Grand Central Madison's escalators from the mezzanine level to the track are 90 feet of elevation change.
Wow I used to work 450 west 33rd on the 11th floor never knew about the ice rink.
"All fascinating, but, increasing demand for office space? Even post-pandemic?"
"HY P2 is supposed to be a mix of office, residential, and also schools and stuff."
"Would be great if it became all residential with a high percentage affordable, but it would probably still feel like living in some weird spaceship."
Nothing near it is 'affordable' so an affordable housing there doesn't make a ton of sense. The gym there (Equinox HY) is now almost $400 a month.
Oh I thought it was $600. Whoops
lol maybe it is now but I was grandfathered when it was just a tad over $300. Now Equinox is trying to make it even more exclusive and price goug new members.
What's the name of the book
Wow. Great selection of infobits
Thank you for this! There is some stuff I mention on the tour here (like the area being built over a train yard) but I could also hammer it in a bit more. I did not know about the hurricane sandy turnstile bit

Maybe I'm cynical but I never expected anything interesting out of the development.
"However, this never bothered me, because of the technical challenges of constructing a platform capable of holding up skyscrapers on top of an active train yard that only shut down for an hour or two each day. I never expected another 285 Kent to W 33rd St."
"And while I'm no great fan of all the glass curtain wall towers in this city, I do like how HY fills out the skyline. And there are bathrooms there, an amenity the train yards never offered. Could have done without the tax subsidies though."
That whole area used to be bathroom
"Yeah, but now there's toilet paper."

"Another one - just south of Hudson yards there‚Äôs a large private preK-12 school where parents spend $66k per year on their kids tuition. Right across the street, there is one of the larger project buildings in Manhattan where the median household income is <$30k. There‚Äôs a documentary on HBO called Class Divide about it"
Ahhh is that why the bar right there is called Death Ave? Who knew
This is blowing my mind.
1 more reply
Not fun fact - one of the Avenues kids from that documentary committed suicide
Which school is it?
Avenues
"Thanks- my friends Mom used to be head of school at Corlears, but I realized that is down by Chelsea Mkt not Hudson Yards"
"We do talk about death Avenue, but I didn‚Äôt know about the ultra expensive school! Thank you"
"I'm not claiming Hudson Yards is amazing or anything, but I am not surprised that a lot of visitors want to go there. The Edge observation deck is supposed to be good. I hear mixed reviews, but I think Mercado Little Spain is pretty good. I also imagine the crazy skyline of the area is appealing to some."
"Yeah I think people want to see it but not really hear about it, even though it‚Äôs my job to tell them about it"
"You're the tour guide so you tell me if I'm wrong, but I feel like the stuff people are most interested in hearing about on walking tours of a city is the history of the place and places where you can see the history still preserved. HY doesn't really have that."
I would be interested in stories about the companies and people at the companies with headquarters there.
"Steve Cohen, L‚ÄôOr√©al, BlackRock, Kate Spade."
Make it very ‚Äúsuccession‚Äù among the skyscrapers
Coach and HBO headquarters are there too. Some interesting commuters among the tourists.
"Well, if you go super dark, several people have jumped to their death off The Vessel"
"We really enjoyed the Edge. The view is incredible and the plexi bottom it has in parts made for a bit of an extra thrill. It's very professionally run and we had a better time there than at 30 Rock, fwiw."
You can also get drunk up there!! Cocktails are expensive but it‚Äôs a cool experience for a special occasion
Mercado Little Spain is the one thing I find appealing about HY.
"The Edge is the least interesting of the observation decks. no way I would do that one over WTC, Empire State, Top Of The Rock. Haven't seen One Vanderbilt."
Disagree. For me it‚Äôs
30 Rock - Love the central park view
Edge - Open air deck takes it above WTC
WTC - Hate that‚Äôs it‚Äôs inside for the normal ticket
ESB - The railing made me hate it. Even if that‚Äôs a dumb reason it‚Äôs the worst option for me
The ESB is the worst for a simpler reason - you don‚Äôt get the view of the fucking ESB from there. What exactly is NYCs skyline without it?
3 more replies
I've done them all and i have to say the edge is the winner for me. I was absolutely blown away by the view.
The Edge is definitely better than the empire state building's view.
I enjoy walking in and out of the art galleries along the High Line. They're all free to browse and you never know what you'll find. My favorite gallery is the High Line Nine.
"Of course, that's all Chelsea, not really HY."
It‚Äôs cool in a sci-if dystopia kinda way.
"Westworld filmed parts of its final season there, so yep."
"Yes, this exactly. It reminds me quite a bit of Gattaca."
"Pieds-a-terre for the super wealthy, it‚Äôs a regular Hunger Games."
Plus the vessel is like the cornucopia!
I agree with the guy who hates Blank Street‚Äîthe construction is what‚Äôs interesting. It‚Äôs a neighborhood built on top of a train depot.
"The subway art at the 7 train station (""Funktional Vibrations"" by Xenobia Bailey) is pretty cool, and had a fascinating process (Bailey's work is more along the lines of quilting and soft sculpture, which was translated to a mosaic, I think by Italian tileworkers)."
"There's an outpost of Kossar's, the legendary bialy bakery. And I think Russ & Daughters is opening a new location there (to complement their LES locations and their shop/bakery and appetizing prep kitchen at the Navy Yard). Both stores have legendary histories they're building on at HY."
There's the drama over the west side heliport (which for a time had a court order to close it and is generally a nuisance).
"The NHL Store (technically at Manhattan West) has a little display from the Hockey Hall of Fame, which is probably good for a 10-minute visit."

The best thing about Hudson Yards is the 7 Train to Queens!
If it is running

Walking down Madison that last block towards Library Way from Grand Central Terminal is another good spot for sparkly sidewalks!
Have you considered asking for feedback from your tours? That will likely be the best way to gauge. Tourist mentality is very different to a locals mentality
"We do ask people for reviews, but my employer hasn‚Äôt shared them with me yet."
""
This is the real answer.
This is it
This is the stuff I‚Äôm interested in and I‚Äôll def work it in
"I‚Äôm not a huge fan of Hudson Yards, but it‚Äôs not hard to find some interesting points."
"Most expensive private development in US history Highest outdoor deck in the Western Hemisphere. Built by a billionaire who owns the Miami Dolphins and built Time Warner Center. Global headquarters of several Fortune 500 companies including Coach, Time Warner, and Pfizer. They have a bid to develop a casino on the western yards. The Shed  expands by rolling on those giant wheels."
"And it‚Äôs interesting to point out its faults. The Vessel was billed as the Eiffel Tower of NY but instead‚Ä¶ The  outdated mall and the failure of Neiman Marcus. Most of the buildings are by different architects but it all falls flat. The gardens were marketed to be the new Bryant Park, the open space is a glorified driveway for tenants. Aside from Little Spain, the way I it interacts with the city is abysmal.. etc etc"
"Hudson Yards doesn‚Äôt bother me and I like it from far away from some angles. Before it was built, almost no one went west of eight avenue between 23rd and 42nd streets."
""
"Look at old maps online with the old neighborhood zip codes, street names, etcetera, and then look for newspaper articles with information. When I was a flight attendant, sometimes we would be asked about specific areas, and that is what I would do in order to come up with some fresh views for my passengers."
"Also, tourists love stuff about the mafia, and don't forget all of the different crime syndicates, including the Irish as well as the Italian. That was something that everyone was really interested in."
"I came up with interesting ""time fillers"" when I had to conduct a tour, such as ""dog walkers here can earn over 50K"" (I am making the amount up.)"
"See if there are elite shops in the area that this is one of their few locations. Look for any celebrities that live in the area. People really like that, whether they like the celebrity or not. It makes them feel like they are ""breathing special air"" or something."
Good luck!
"Thank you! I mentioned the mafia with the Jacob Javits center, but I can probably bring that into the highline as well"
""
"I kinda don't blame the tourists. The whole place seems like it wasn't made for them, or us for that matter. It comes off to me as a haven for the rich. I've looked around there, and there doesn't seem to be anything there made to accommodate anyone making under 6 figures. Everything (stores, restaurants) is high-end. There's absolutely no reason for, say, a middle class family of four to go there."
"I would go to New York Comic Con over at the Javits Center in years past, and lament that the entire area immediately around the center was dead. Imagine if there were bars and restaurants, places of commerce as soon as you stepped outside. It would be amazing! And now they do it, but we can't afford any of it."
"It's funny, the best sign of the opulence of the Hudson Yards to me is that in one episode of Succession, (If you don't know, it's a show about rich assholes. It's great!) Kendall Roy (one such rich asshole) held his birthday party in The Shed. As soon as I realized where it was, I was like ""Of course."""
"Oh I fuckin‚Äô love succession, and my coworker told me Kendall had his birthday party in the shed!! I think we have a lot of European tourists on the tours so I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôd be interested in succession. I also think part of the issue might be a language barrier, but I‚Äôm gonna try to work on some of the stuff I learned here for my tour today"
"They should setup some displays or a little museum to show what that area use to be before and how it became what it is, that‚Äôs the most interesting part of the area. Most people would have never guessed all those buildings are sitting atop a train yard"
"On the way to the viewing platform at the edge they have this. Cutaway diagrams, examples of the posts that hold the whole thing up, history of the train yards, etc"
Awe I‚Äôm an employee of Hudson yards and there is a lot of super cool things about it!!!!! It‚Äôs an old (literally) Hudson River yard where so much nyc history took place. Plus the construction is the most prestigious construction project in nyc history!!! And it‚Äôs still ongoing. It‚Äôll be the new finance center!
Go through the history of the yards themselves!! Shipping was a huge deal in that area!!! And they continued that commerce center into modern day!
It will make zero sense to make it the new finance center. Its somewhat of a transit desert and there is nothing around it to make the move reasonable. I can‚Äôt visualize that happening.
Actually agree. I have to walk from penn every day. But the sunsets are beautiful (:
"Honestly...no, zilch, nada...total waste of a HUGE amount of money. The Beehive that they had to close cuz of all the suicide jumpers cost $ 280,000,000.00."
"When the Vessel was open I would have told any tourist to go see it. Walking Ip and down inside that thing was amazing. A truly unique piece of public art. Once it closed, which frankly should have been predictable, there‚Äôs really no reason to go to Hudson Yards unless your a rich kid who wants to spend daddy‚Äôs money in the shopping mall that the average New Yorker cannot shop at."
I was a rebar and weld inspector for 2 of the towers there from its inception. So the construction sites were a marvel to witness!..... the end product has a lot left to be desired.
""
Thank you!!
"This is a fantastic article. It might be too detailed to give on the tour, but I‚Äôll make sure I‚Äôll summarize it for people. Thanks again"
Can you research the history of what used to be in that area?  maybe find some photos of what used to be there or just some stories about how the neighborhood has changed?  How about some statistics about the cost of living or the average income of people who live out there or what notable companies are headquartered there?
"We do discuss previous plans for the neighborhood, and we have some photos. I would def look up how the average cost of living changed though, that should be good! Thank you!"
"The previous plans are the only thing I can think of (it was considered as a potential site for the 2012 Olympics), but that‚Äôs not even that interesting."
"You‚Äôre welcome!  When I was a tourist before I moved to NYC, I took one of those Circle cruises around the Hudson river and there was a stat that one of the tour guides gave that there‚Äôs 1 million millionaires in Manhattan.  I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs true or not but it was kind of an ooh ahh moment.  If all else fails just make stuff up."
"I would actually love some info about becoming a tour guide! I‚Äôm about to take the test soon! Also, when are your tours bc I‚Äôd love to go on one!"
"I do a Hudson Yards tour at 2:30 pretty often, I‚Äôll dm you my company and you can tell me if I am boring or not"
It‚Äôs cool for photography and if you‚Äôre interesting in architecture. It also kind of feels a bit like walking into how I imagined future ‚Äúbig cities‚Äù to look when I was a kid.
Not one thing.
"Tell them the cost of the apartments that you can look into like a zoo from the highline. It's a nice area, and I could probably never afford to live in one during my lifetime, but way too many eyes gawking into living rooms, patios, and common spaces. People can connect bc they'll know how much prices back at home are."
We have shades‚Ä¶
"One of my crabby old coworkers on the cruise boats was on the construction crew that laid the foundation for that thing. He was very proud and would remind us of that fact every time we floated past HY. If it ever falls over, blame John."
"As a frequent tourist to NYC, I really like Hudson Yards but I am a fan of the modern architecture and engineering anyway. I also had the chance to visit the skyscrapers due to work; the engineering and innovative ideas were fascinating. High line is fun too for me, I really like the Frying Pan restaurant. I think if someone is only looking for the historic icons of NYC like Times Square, Empire State, Broadway then HY will let them down. I wish there were more breweries/casual restaurants by the water near HY."
Have you been to Grand Banks?
I have not. Just added it to my to-do list for the next trip.
Hudson yards feels like the oculus in that they both have a similar sterile rich empty look. Of course the oculus has way more to talk about but theyre both just shows of wealth im not surprised they just want to take it in
they need to let some vines and some hangy moss grow on some stuff there it would be badass
Never thought of this before and damn would that be sick if they added natural colors to that sterile white in the form of gardening it somehow
""
Little Mercado is pretty awesome!
"It is, but it‚Äôs also full of slack-jawed, slow moving tourists."
I haven‚Äôt had the food but I can confirm the tourists are slack jawed and move slow
Oddly lots of Spanish tourists!
Well to be fair it‚Äôs a high budget construction funded and operated by corporate fat cats in suits aka all money no soul.
"Hudson Yards was built to be interesting, but there‚Äôs not much inherently interesting about it. The Highline was built for freight trains coming from the Meatpacking District, which makes it now being a public park (or ‚Äúpark analog‚Äù) kind of interesting. But I honestly think the Highline actually appeals more to New Yorkers than tourists. It‚Äôs a very interesting way to stroll through a neighborhood, but what you actually find on the Highline, while nice and well-done, doesn‚Äôt look all that special."
Little Spain.
It‚Äôs actually a very interesting area with lots to see (especially on the High Line). Maybe YOU just sound bored when you‚Äôre talking about it because you don‚Äôt know much about it
""
"That 4 people have jumped off the stairs to nowhere, which cost $150m to build, all while financiers fought to build the entire union with scab labor"
Oh I did not know the scab labor part. Some quotes I heard for the vessel was $200 million. Do you have any article where I can read about the labor issue?
"Lower down on the highline (evidently around meatpacking. district), the trains used to cut through buildings because they would load and unload pork and cow carcasses directly from the train tracks - some of these loading/unloading areas are still identifiable."
That‚Äôs mentioned on another tour I do and I‚Äôm going to start roping it in to this one!
"It‚Äôll take some time before it‚Äôs a neighborhood.  Overtime, more restaurants will open and more people will move in.  As local schools are established, the neighborhood will become permanent.  Personally, I would find growing up in a high rise to be pretty weird, but other NYC kids have done it.  There are kids who live in 15 Hudson Yards building.  I‚Äôve seen them with my own eyes."
"No. It's just a place. Walk by it if you want, but the idea of doing a ""tour"" of it is absolutely inane."
"There are dumb tourist attractions, but touring Hudson Yards is dumber than dumb."
You can tell my company that.
"I live near a minor tourist attraction, and am flabbergasted by the massive throngs that tour companies try to push through bottlenecks and narrow paths. My unmitigated hatred for the walking-tour industry knows no bounds."
"If I ever give them a piece of my mind, telling them to avoid Hudson Yards will be the last thing I think to tell them."
It's interesting to watch people who are fascinated by mundane expensive things.
"I'm guessing this part of the tour is mandated by your employer? I would take a snarky angle if I had to give tours here. Talk about the suicides, the shady dealings of Related Companies (ask if they know who Scabby the inflatable labor dispute rat is), go existential on the expensive mundanity of the shops in the mall, or the politics of people flying into the helipad along the Hudson. ""Three blocks this way is a really great restaurant."" The leaky ceilings of the subway station and the cool angled elevator and the shenanigans that prevented a 10av station from being built. If you look up, it looks like someone went to Shanghai, visited the skyscraper studded park in Lujiazui, looked up, said ""I can do that!"" and ended up creating the tall building equivalent of ""Nailed it!"" Give tourist-watching tips for the high line. Tell them where the Javits is and where all the long distance buses pick up and direct them to where you can see the northbound Amtrak trains snake through the graffiti-strewn bowels of the city. Mention that one of the tallest buildings has the same silhouette as the ""Neighborhood Watch"" creeper seen on signs all over suburban America. Take a poll on whether they think the vessel looks more like a garbage can, a bedbug, a toilet, or a shawarma."
"ETA: ""and remember, the best part about going up to The Edge is that your pictures won't have Hudson Yards in them."""
"Hudson yards is a mall. It‚Äôs a nice mall that‚Äôs convenient if you‚Äôre a suburbs kid like me and needs to go shopping, especially on a rainy day. But it‚Äôs a mall."
"Yeah, it's close to the ferry. Take that ride to Edgewater around sunset and it's just gorgeous, one of the most beautiful sights in the city."
You could say it‚Äôs the closest thing to being in NJ without being in NJ?
I think what makes any NYC tour interesting is how its recent history connects to the past.
"Take most of the old residential buildings along the water in Midtown that are still standing. They look bland and most aren't historically preserved because they were built to house the working class, particularly rail workers who built the El and subway."
"Or maybe you can talk about recent history, like the plane that made an emergency landing on the Hudson before all the newer development."
"Or get anecdotes from locals about changes to the neighborhood, like how the buildings started blocking natural light to my apartment and killed all my indoor plants."
"And aren't the high-rises seismically structured? You can talk about how NYC is technically on a fault line and we had a pretty big quake more than 10 years ago, but hey, these buildings are state of the art! Maybe that will get their attention."
"That whole part of town is built on trash. Literally, they expanded the island of Manhattan westward. They had to close the vessel because people kept jumping off and they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to stop it. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm honestly not a fan of Hudson yards. The mall is fine, but it‚Äôs really out of the way and I feel like the resources could‚Äôve been better used elsewhere. They‚Äôre redoing the Penn Station area now, it‚Äôs going to have the tallest building in the western hemisphere, replacing one world trade center, and that area just simply needed rejuvenations so bad. I think it‚Äôll be good."
what's that regarding the tallest building?
"Since it‚Äôs construction 1 World Trade Center aka freedom tower has been the tallest building in the western hemisphere at 1776 feet tall. However due to strict safety regulations in New York the construction took years to complete. By the time it was completed the technology was already in place to build taller buildings on New Yorks existing infrastructure. Due to its symbolic nature there has been a rule in place keeping buildings from passing 1776 feet. That is now coming to an end though as 4 Penn, part of a new building project in midtown Manhattan will surpass it. Being the tallest building in the new area‚Ä¶‚Ä¶"
Never mind all that stuff I just said. It looks like they might be reviewing their plans because interest rates went up and there is a lower demand for  office space in New York at the moment. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Damn. Last I heard it was a done deal.
? the highline
"No. Hudson Yards is Times Square lite to me. How is there even a Hudson Yards tour, LOL?! I went there once because I had an appointment nearby and noped the fuck out. I immediately felt like I was in Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, or any other random city in America. Bland and uninteresting - And now being forced on people as some sort of tourist attraction when there's no there there. Horrible."
The high line is nice to walk like once or twice a year.
The vessel is cool to visit also like once or twice a year.
"That‚Äôs really it, I only go when I have friends from out of town that really wanna go."
"As a native New Yorker I find the whole area to be nothing special really, also just hate that part of town in general."
"How the developers took over a billion dollars for the project that should have gone to impoverished areas is interesting, but might not be the vibe you want to set for your tours."
hard to think of much past the big suicide gyro spit
"It‚Äôs a monument to corruption, greed, and how government and Wall Street have transformed real estate into an investment vehicle with complete disregard for actually giving people a place to live."
"almost like when you create a sterile environment where only the super wealthy can afford to live, there's no culture or anything interesting happening. This is the wealthy's goal for all of manhattan."
It sucks! My family grew up in Manhattan and even seeing the huge changes over the course of my lifetime (as I visited family and friends) has been a downer
West 33rd Street used to be at a lower elevation.
The elevator from the HY stop of the 7 is an INCLINED FUNICULAR. Goes pretty slow to deter unnecessary use but it‚Äôs a rare use of passenger elevators.
The avant gallery inside the shops area always has cool art. Maybe make that a stop
They have nice flowers. Should shrug.
"Walking tour guide in another city here. If you‚Äôre the creator of a tour and you have to go to Reddit to ask this question, you don‚Äôt know the area well enough to be creating a tour of it. If this is a tour script that someone else has provided, they‚Äôve done a shitty job."
Im not the creator of the tour. The script I was given is already outdated (because it was made in 2019) so I‚Äôve been doing my own research. I think it being the site of a lot of trains is cool but dads from the Netherlands don‚Äôt always feel the same
Working with a shitty script isn‚Äôt fun. Good luck with your research.
Thank you! I really do try to be a good tour guide and not just make things up haha
"It's been a while but they have tried to do things to make it more lively. There are events like farmer's markets. Livestreaming of sports games outside, and free yoga there. The Shed is actually not that bad to check out too."
It‚Äôs just not a neighborhood. It‚Äôs so corporate and gray and depressing.
"It will be a neighborhood in time.  Once schools are built, kids will fill the schools and then it‚Äôll be a neighborhood.   Stores and services and stuff are nice, but it‚Äôs families that‚Äôll make the neighborhood.  There are families that live within Hudson yards now."
Not at all.  It‚Äôs cursed because they misappropriated the funds.  Just look at all the suicides that happened there.
Lol.  I feel the same way!
"The construction itself is probably interesting, the Hay looks like a suburban shopping mall though so ugly and non functional and expensive"
Shopping and views
"The Spanish food court in the lower level of the mall there is good.  Otherwise, just high end stores there."
I'd skip giving a Hudson Yards tour tbh. The city has plenty of actual neighborhoods that are a million times more interesting
"The company pays pretty well but I agree, I think my other tours will be more fun"
You could point to the edge and reference the Mike Myers movie where a helicopter landed there as an entrance to an evil layer (the Triumvirate IIRC)
Oooh nice tip!! Thank you!
The story of the 152 Million dollar McDonald's that was on the corner of 34th and 10th avenue:
https://ny.curbed.com/2015/10/5/9914358/final-piece-of-the-hudson-yards-pie-finally-acquired-by-related
"Oh I mention that McDonald‚Äôs as the (former) only drive through McDonalds in Manhattan, but I‚Äôm gonna read this article. Thank you!"
The ones that profited more than the developers were the auto repair / junk yards below it. Cashed out!
Oooh this is fascinating! Is there anywhere where I can read more about this?
"Hi! When I show out of towners the area, I usually start in the village, cross into meatpacking, and take the high line. It‚Äôs a good visual story of a preexisting community with a ton of culture, then investment in public space (high line), gentrification, and then that investment kind of going nuts (HY)."
"There‚Äôs a few good gradients where the high line simultaneously has you looking at shorter, older buildings and new, blobbier ones, pretty good visual example of change in NYC."
"The Shed is the most interesting place there, but Hudson Yards is just a mall, really. It‚Äôs new boring glass buildings, the vessel, which sucks, and shops. That‚Äôs it. This is coming from someone who used to work at The Shed. HY is a nothing."
"Sorry but f*ck Hudson Yards, then-Mayor Bloomberg's scheme to make his super-rich friends richer."
Free toilet at the mall
"I do love those free toilets. Mall is lacking in outlets for charging phones, though"
Can't argue with that
"Worst new project in all of Manhattan possibly the country!  If you go to the Design District in Miami and see the unique architecture each building has, it set the bar for a luxury area.  Hudson is a mall that would only wow in Cincinatti (I‚Äôll never understand the bottle next of people at the blue bottle coffee / bathroom / escalator."
"Tell them about the Vessel, how it was once a tourist attraction, I thought it was cool, until people started to jump off it! That should liven the tour up."
The post specifically mentions that.
Missed that.
Jimmy Hoffa is buried in the Hudson yards. Tell them Jack the Ripper went on vacation killed a few hookers out there.
Nothing. I had an office there for a while. It is the most boring Manhattan neighborhood.
Have you ever been to the top of The Vessel?
We aren‚Äôt allowed anymore because of the suicide shawarma deaths
No
The Equinox there is pretty cool
No.
That bit about the vessel is almost all I have. Other than people pay to climb a stairway at the top of the building that's on the top of the building that has the observation deck. Thinking of doing it myself to be honest.
"No. It's a gross pimple on the city, and no real New Yorker would set foot there. It was built with stolen funds from affordable housing for no reason whatsoever but to house the corporate cancers of the city, and a sweet gift to the developers from our corrupt politicians. I guess that's what's interesting about it - New Yorkers hate it."
I said that same thing.  That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs cursed!
""
It is very fitting that Westworld filmed here
The shed can become an outdoor performance space bc the roof moves and is powered by an electric car battery. Check the promo info from the architects for more ‚Äúfun‚Äù facts.
"There‚Äôs a mall, have you gone to The mall? There‚Äôs a mall."
Is there anything interesting about you?
"Yes, but I‚Äôm not a tourist attraction in a major city."
Are you a big Apple greeter?
Maybe the kinds of people that choose to do a paid tour of Hudson Yards are just more boring than those who choose a more interesting location. They might just be waiting to go to the mall and Chelsea Market.
The Shed is a really cool museum.
I think they filmed some scenes of the final season of Westworld there in the courtyard
Take them to Wah Fung in Chinatown
Kendall Roy lives there.
But I do love the high line
Wait he lives there? I thought he just had his birthday party at the shed. That almost makes it more depressing
"There was a scene where I recall he was at home and on his balcony, and I saw that weird octagon stair statue in the background."
"Nobody mentioned the tree roots being ""air conditioned"" with slabs of cooled concrete."
Depends perspective
As a business owner -- you get better clients that pay 30-50%++ more
Food in the area sucks - Uber eats will be 2-4k++ a month
Transportation sucks -- add at least 2000++ to your transport's cost
Snow bird love it
Gary Vee‚Äôs office lol ; other than that no
"It‚Äôs the same in Long Island City.  30 years ago, I toured some pretty bombed out scary warehouses looking to start a small manufacturing business.  It was too scary for me.  Jersey City, NJ was just as bad.  We ended up in NJ.  Safe and boring."
"These guys basically made land.  For the western yard, they will make land again.  There will be more residential in the second phase, but it looks as though they are pushing for a casino (Wynn).   They did a presentation to the condo owners at #15 and #35 this past July.  Espousing the virtues of their plan.  I think it‚Äôs gross and the only virtue is maybe a good buffet.  Aside from this, maybe 10 times odds craps ?"
The only thing interesting about HY is the view from across the Hudson. It looks like a city within the city.
Give it time.  Things change.  Things fill in.
