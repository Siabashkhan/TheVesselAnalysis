"Well, that sucks."
"Last time I was in NYC, it was nearing completion and I‚Äôve been looking forward to climbing it on my next visit."
Is it a giant art piece ?
"Yeah, kind of, it‚Äôs a huge basket-like series of stairs that don‚Äôt really  go anywhere. Kind of like a giant MC Escher sculpture. You climb up them and back down, and there are various views of the city and river. It‚Äôs in the middle of a giant new development called Hudson yards, with lots of high-end residential skyscrapers.  But, as I said, I have never been on it."

"It‚Äôs pretty sad, over the last decade we‚Äôve seen an onslaught of these luxury high rise apartment complexes, many around Central Park just dominating the skyline. These places are ghost towns, you barely see any lights on at night. They‚Äôre all bought up by wealthy foreigners who don‚Äôt live in them, they just use as a safe haven to protect their fortunes from economic instability in other countries or good ol‚Äô fashioned money laundering via luxury real estate."
"Do you skip an NYC visit because of our laws? I hate some of our laws too, some with a passion, but it‚Äôs a really damn cool place to visit (and live!). I‚Äôd urge you to reconsider. Whatever your thing is, be it art, live music, food, parks, even beaches, there‚Äôs plenty of it. And part of what makes it so awesome is that it‚Äôs just full of people from everywhere and every which background you could imagine. You can go out just for a night and wind up with a group of new friends from all over the world. If I wake up at 2am, can‚Äôt get back to sleep and decide I feel like watching some live jazz, you can do that! There‚Äôs everything all the time. Hope you can make it out someday. It can be a frustrating home base to the extent of banging your head against the wall at times, but I‚Äôve never been anywhere that quite compares to it. And I can‚Äôt really imagine living anywhere else. And PS - it does look pretty damn cool. My old office had a pretty decent view of the honeycomb and I miss the view out the floor‚Äôs main window around sunset time heading home after a long day of work."
Wtf u talking about? What law in nyc is different than any other place lol

It looks like a cool city. Live and work in. Metro Detroit. Alot of Detroit is a urban wasteland.
Don't know why I'm getting all the down votes. I guess my opinion is incorrect.
It's a giant commercial gimmick.
it‚Äôs a art piece/ tourist draw. most tourist attractions are gimmicks
"I remember climbing to the top of that thing in 2019, cool view. I do feel like if I wasn‚Äôt careful though I would‚Äôve fallen."
How? Its just stairs
Yeah but there‚Äôs also a ledge as you can see.
I went there in 2019 when it first opened and I definitely see how this happened. The railings only came to my stomach (I'm 5'5 ish.) At the top level I was pretty cautious about where and how I moved. It was a cool art piece but it was placed in such a poor location. On one side you could see the train yard and on the other there was a brand new mall filled with overpriced and expensive stores. It was pretty depressing to be around if I'm being honest.
"Yeah the location fucking sucks. Hudson Yards is ugly and the train yard is cool, but not very pretty. Further south near meat packing would have been a better spot, over by where little island is"
"Its cool, and it‚Äôs a shame it‚Äôs closing but‚Ä¶ two hundred million dollars?!"
"There are so many ways to spend $200,000,000 that are more impressive than this."
That is so ugly. I‚Äôd rather have a park with some trees then some obscure concrete structure.
"Swings on those trees, benches under them, a duck pond nearby, etc."
"The Vessel is temporarily closed, hopefully because they are preparing to build barriers to prevent people from jumping in the future. There have been suicides there all year and each time they have temporarily closed it and put in place other restrictions (like increased security and requiring visitors to enter in pairs) to prevent people from jumping, but they have not yet built higher barriers at the top levels like they should have after the first suicides occurred. From the design alone it was obvious at the outset that this would be a huge problem, and Hudson Yards should not be taking this long to either build higher barriers or permanently close the structure to visitors. It‚Äôs abhorrent that keeping the original design was more important to them than preventing deaths."
They can put a big swimming pool or trampolines at the bottom.  If someone jumps off they will just end up having fun instead of dying. Sounds good for depression
Water acts like concrete at a high enough velocity
Can confirm. I live near a bridge that is a popular jumping off place.  üòß
Coronado?
"Bay area, not the Golden gate."
Except concrete doesn't give you a break if you point your toes downward before you make contact.
It gives you many breaks(I know someone would say something like this so.. first.)
I concur
Lonely ppl cant enjoy nothing these days
"There were a total of 4 suicides since it opened in 2019, so ""all year"" is true but makes it sound like people are committing suicide 1+ times a month"
"For more context: The first suicide was in February 2020, so in 1.5 years there have been four. That‚Äôs one every 4-5 months or so. The victims have all been in their mid-20s or younger. The latest victim was just 14 years old and was visiting the Vessel with his family."
Thanks for the details - I was on my phone and forgot the timeline from when I read about it over a week ago
What‚Äôs more abhorrent is that tickets cost $10 per person solely to go up a useless staircase‚Ä¶
Is it wrong that i like how this looks?
"No, you can like whatever you want"
A lot of people in the arch community like its aesthetics
"A lot people also hate its context (the development around it), owner, and lack of regard for practical safety. Especially several suicides deep and not doing anything to it because ""it ruins the art."""
It hardly the creators fault that a bunch of crazies are jumping off. They would probably just head to the Brooklyn bridge or maybe dive in front of a train if this didn‚Äôt exist.
"Totally agree, idk why are you downvoted Edit: How are you going to prevent people from killing themselves by putting barriers on a single building?"
Arch community?  Where do I join
St. Louis
The hell part may be referring to the suicides.
"Ah NYC‚Äôs lovely giant suicide lamb gyro rotisserie cooker‚Äî instagram stage, is now closed?! How could they?! And people say it isnt just the best thing since the Chrysler building!"
No benches ;_;
I was there 2 weeks ago with my old man walking the highline  14 yro kid jumped in front of his whole family shits fucked up .
"just looked at a street view photo sphere from on top of it and I've got to say those hand rails wont keep you off if you're determined or taller than 4'11"", I have had depressed friends and friends who have self harmed and I feel obligated to make them know they are needed and appreciated, but never yet have I seen someone jump off the roof or onto the tracks and I do not long for when that day does unavoidably come."
I don't know what they thought was going to happen.
"Interesting stuff happening at the top left, one level down on the first pic..."
holy crap whaaaaat i went on that thing twice definitely makes sense about suicides but wouldnt expect that to happen right there‚Ä¶
"It‚Äôs kinda like a vertical combination of stairs and landings. I remember climbing it when it opened to the public. The overwhelming feeling I got from it was it felt so grand and so cold, very deadening. I mean it‚Äôs sculpturally cool, it just doesn‚Äôt support happy vibes"
"The Vessel is absolutely, positively, in no way, shape or form ""Manhattan's Eiffel Tower."""
Attention Giant Space Bees your condo is ready to move in to!
"I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords. As a trusted local celebrity, I can be useful in rounding up others to toil in the underground sugar caves."
"I don't think that doesn't make much sense, aren't people just going to commid suicide somewhere else?"
"Suicide tends to be a very spur of the moment thing. Testimonials from survivors of jumps show that the second they jumped, they felt the most intense feeling of regret. Removing quick, irreversible methods like jumping and firearms allows the regret to set in and prevents completion."
Thank you for explaining üôè
ITS SO FUCKING UGLY
Just build some cheap apartments and move on.
What an eyesore.
No bike lanes????
Lol i get it
Damn I should have been visiting there.
I‚Äôm a native New Yorker and I‚Äôve never seen this.
bruh wtf?
You've been living under a pretty large rock?
Nope.
It‚Äôs in Hudson Yards that huge new but down by the river
This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things. Silly depressed people thinking killing them selves will end the pain.
"Actually, suicide is 100% effective at ending pain"
Too dark?  I‚Äôve been a doom and gloomer all my life. Been downright suicidal myself a couple of times.
Sorry to hear that. I‚Äôve been there too. Living is way cooler though
"Yup. Interesting also, and quite pleasant now that I‚Äôve actually retired."
It does in a way...
Did I need a /s?
"If I wanted to kill myself, which I do often, this would probably be the place to do it."
"It‚Äôs sad that we have to deny everyone access to something beautiful just because a few people used it to take the cowards way out. If people want to kill themselves, they will find a way."
Incorrect and a shit way of thinking about people also.
"From a comment above: ‚ÄúSuicide tends to be a very spur of the moment thing. Testimonials from survivors of jumps show that the second they jumped, they felt the most intense feeling of regret. Removing quick, irreversible methods like jumping and firearms allows the regret to set in and prevents completion.‚Äù"
They could just go to the Brooklyn bridge or jump in front of a subway car. We shouldn‚Äôt waste effort trying to make the world suicide-proof. We shouldn‚Äôt close down things that people enjoy just to cater to the 1 in a million who want to kill themselves.
"Its at least 1 in 58 deaths though, rather than 1 in 1,000,000. Suicide isn't really uncommon. Not saying this in favour or against your statement- just spreading awareness how many people feel the need to end it."
El trompo de pastor.
"A giant, wildly inefficient suicide machine sounds about right for where we are."
Exactly stairway to nowhere. Symbolic of something scary. Maybe the end.
"Damn. I was in NYC a few weeks ago and climbed to the top of this thing. It‚Äôs really eerie to think the day after we climbed, someone jumped. I hope it reopens because it really is a marvelous piece of architecture, but safety always comes first."
Looks incredible
Just bulldoze this useless structure
