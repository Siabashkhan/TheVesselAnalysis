Forever closed... lol
Gigantic waste of space now
Always was.
Some ppl have no foresight.  NYers saw the issue from miles away.
Was closed because of the suicides that took place there.
NYers knew this would be an issue
It still baffles me that nobody has bothered to go inside the shopping mall to accomplish the same feat.  Symbols and human psychology are weird.
How do the prevent it on the Eiffel Tower?
"I’ve been there, the top is a completely enclosed by a fence"
Good question.  I don’t know much about it.
The only time it’s looked good. Great work OP.
Tear it down already.
"Eh, it is still a gimmick that attracts tourists."
And it isn't like tearing it down would free up space in that plaza for anything functional.
Raised planters and outdoor seating with a small takeaway restaurant similar to Shake Shack in Madison Sq Park. Or outdoor flexible / pop-up event space like the areas around the lawn at Bryant Park.
"Creating more outdoor places for people to sit, gather, relax, read, eat, etc. would be solid alternatives for the space."
But that ship sailed at the design development phase. The vessel isn't going anywhere.
There is enough space in the plaza to do all of that already. The actual ground-level footprint of The Vessel really isn't that large at all.
"Raised planters already exist there, as does ample outdoor seating."
Hudson Yards could have different food trucks and pop-up events every single week with room to spare.
"Even with The Vessel there, the plaza has A LOT of unused space. Nothing you're proposing can't already be done."
It's actually surprising how under-utilized that entire plaza is.
It’s evil looking. Bad juju.
Gimmick? Why so salty? It's a pretty cool piece of engineering
What makes my comment seem salty to you?
It is a gimmick.
Calling it one doesn't detract from the architectural or engineering creativity of the structure itself
The Shawarma.
wonderful use of color
"People like to hate on it but I was able to climb up it in September 2020 before it closed and it was amazing. A free cool looking sculpture with nice views built without public funds for everyone to enjoy. I hope it reopens soon! The suicides are tragic but not uncommon. In the first years of Central Park the New York Times reported on suicides every couple of weeks, the solution was not to close Central Park or stop building it."
It will never reopen because every time it does someone decides to jump off it. It has some weird pull on the suicidal.
Call of the void
they should open it anyway for the majority of people to enjoy. why do we allow a small minority of selfish people to ruin things for the rest of society?
"Yeah but the architect was told before it built how it was dangerous and how to improve it and said that the improvements would harm the design. In fact he said, ""We don't want to design in fear"" So unless they really change it they won't."
Too much of an optimist
Surround it with a big deep moat so all the jumpers can do is make a splash.
This is the windiest spot on planet Earth
This will be iconic 50 years from now mark my words
people like to romanticize this monstrosity?
it literally looks evil
I really don’t get why people hate on it this much. It’s just public art—there is nothing inherently evil about it or how it looks. I actually think it looks quite cool.
Maybe you think evil is cool
Hudson yard is an evil place and it's fitting to have an evil piece of public art
More people have died jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge. Do you look at that and think “evil”?
lol yeah obviously i’m also referring to the design and appearance as well not just the fact it’s a suicide machine
It makes people who climb it decide to kill themselves
Suicide tower!
...and the 50 foot magnifying glass. And that escalator to nowhere.
Ah yes. Lemming tower.
Jesus
Such an ugly monstrosity. Fitting for the whole Hudson Yards development. The Vessel should be torn down.
Are those the bodies at the bottom?
Do not taunt happy fun structure
"Based of a photo, i assume. Still, very nice execution."
Dark place
Is haunted
Reminds me of Architect's Leap at Carnegie Mellon University
