"As soon as I saw this thing the first time, I thought, ""people are going to use this to commit suicide."" It was so obvious, don't know how tf they decided not to put up netting or a barrier."
The fact that they didn't install vertical barriers after the first incident is unconscionable. It's such an easy fucking fix.
It's a billionaire's vanity project and he won't pay for that.
""
Yeah I think the people of Harlem should receive free tickets to jump off it whenever they want without reservations. /S
They should send u and your mom those free tickets so you and her could jump clown
Was it really THAT surprising that everywhere one can fall off or jump from someone will fall or jump from? A suicidal will pretty sure find a mountain or rock elsewhere. At some point a society cannot help anymore. IMHO closing a works of art for this reason seems exaggerated and is a bit overreacting. If there is honest interest to help suicidal then society must react way before.
"It is well studied that most suicide attempts are impulsive decisions. People are generally suicidal for a long time, but that feeling accelerates to action very suddenly. I mean literal minutes. Studies show a significant percentage of attempts (as high as 25%) are made within 5 minutes of deciding to act, and the vast majority of attempts are made within 24 hours. And like many impulsive decisions, if people are forced to take more time to think about it, they will often change their minds. Making suicide literally more inconvenient to do can give people enough time to reconsider and potentially be helped."
This is why some ovens were banned.
But we still allow firearms. Which have definitely resulted in more suicides than this staircase.
"Yes. And New York already has some of the strictest gun control laws in the country, which is why the state has the 5th lowest rate of gun ownership (~20%), and the city is even lower than that. So while guns account for just over 50% of all suicides nationally, they only account for 26% in New York."
"And even in New York, it's much easier to tell one guy to put up some barriers on a pointless structure than it is to pass more gun control legislation. There's no reason we can't do both."
Couldn't agree more.
50% of Americans killed by a gun actually committed suicide.
And we speak about barriers on buildings. Really?
"Yes, welcome to the conversation where people are talking about barriers on buildings…"
They closed the roofs of the local university after my sister's best friend jumped to her death.
I'm fine with saving other lives.
""
""
"People like this are ignoring the fact that many who are suicidal would prefer a means that's less dramatic than bridge jumping or firearms even- like medication.  Of course medically assisted suicide is never an option for these moralizers who are more interesting in enforcing their version of morality upon everyone else than actually helping others who want a way ""out."""
Yeah - let's ban a civil right simply because some might missuse it....
"They didn't need to close it. All they had to do was install vertical barriers, which they were advised to do and which we know work, after the first incident. Instead they allowed it to become a site for death tourism and now it will likely close forever. It was exceedingly simple to fix the fucking issue and keep it open and safe."
"You can kill yourself at the Guggenheim; way easier, lower walls."
"OK, I'm not the only one who stared down and thought ""holy shit these are low walls.""  I feel like if you're over 6' and you fell forward your center of gravity would be above the ledge easily."
""
"I remember the first time I went there they had this HUGE painting set at one end of this room; the painting must have been twenty feet wide. I took a step back to try and capture more of it in my field of vision and my leg bumped against one of the low benches they had set in the gallery. That bench was only a couple feet from the railing, and if I had tripped over it I would have toppled right over the railing and into the ballroom. It was in that moment, at the age of 14, that I truly became aware of my own mortality."
"Anyway the Crocker is a really lovely little museum, and if you ever find yourself in Sacramento you should go."
Frank Loyd Wright was a short man and made the banister height for himself. Since it’s a national landmark it doesn’t need to meet codes in the same way.
And yet I don't see any documented cases of that happening in the Guggenheim. Meanwhile this is the 4th death at the Vessel in 2 years. Are we really going to try to whatabout this as if they didn't purposefully allow this to continue?
"You can kill yourself nearly anywhere in NYC. I get what your saying, making it harder to Jill yourself on the vessel specifically isn’t a terrible idea. I don’t like the president it sets. It’s not the responsibility of a property owner to prevent people from killing themselves."
It is absolutely the responsibility of property owners to make it harder for people to fall to their deaths (on purpose or not) in their buildings and structures. It would have been exceedingly easy for them to do so. This wasn't uncharted territory.
Are you for real??
"100%, each persons will to live is there own. If they want to check out I don’t think we should hand them a gun and make it easy, but we shouldn’t burden the rest of society with their safety."
You should tell your theory to the MTA. I hear they have some train platforms without guardrails… also the TBA has a bridge or two that might need a bubble around it.
Do you think your comments are bringing something worthwhile to this conversation?
We have a legal system. Having established defined rules is very helpful for a safe productive society.
Now look up sovereign immunity.
"The term you want is ""attractive nuisance"" and it is absolutely the property owner's responsibility."
In general attractive nuisance laws only apply when the youth would NOT understand the harm they would receive from said nuisance. I think it would be hard to argue that someone large enough to climb over the guard rail was doing so with an understanding of the outcome.
My point is that this sets no precedent. The laws and concepts exist.
You can easily make the case that at 14 they are too young to understand suicide. Physical size has little to do with mental ability or maturity.
Four people have killed themselves jumping from the Vessel. It has been open 28 months. Minus Covid. No one has committed suicide inside the Guggenheim. It has been open 60 years.
Maybe you are missing something.
"“a suicidal”? come on man, have some humanity. if you wouldn’t call someone “a gay” or “a chinese,” what makes you think “a suicidal” is appropriate?"
I am not a native speaker. What’s wrong?
"sorry, your english is very good so i had no idea. i just see it a lot and it irks me. basically, the word you used (and the ones i used) are identifiers. when you say it the way you said it (“a suicidal”), it is dehumanizing because it diminishes that person to one aspect of their life. i hear it a lot with “a transgender” or “a black.” the appropriate thing to say would be “a suicidal person,” “a trans person,” “a black person,” etc."
"native speakers usually understand what i mean immediately when i put it that way, but if you aren’t a native speaker i can totally understand why you said it that way and why you wouldn’t understand what i meant!"
"I see .. so “suicidal” as a noun is basically stripping of all other aspects and roles of the person, but when used as an adjective it leaves all aspects open? In German we use kind of “a person in danger to commit suicide” that exists as a noun, I.e. “Selbstmordgefährdeter“. Thanks for your explanation."
pretty much. so the appropriate way to talk about someone suicidal would be to say “they are suicidal” or “they were suicidal” or “a suicidal person.” not “they were a suicidal” or “they are a suicidal.” hope that makes sense! i can understand the translation issue if your language has a noun that actually conveys an entire phrase
"I agree with you dude. They don't care that he had the intention to kill himself, they just care about where he chose to do it. He could have jumped from his own rooftop and none of these people would be fostering  the same amount of outcry."
Or we recognize that suicide is impulsive. People jump from attractive places and from places known to be used for suicide. Stopping them has a very high success rate in preventing the suicide.
Yeah just close it for the hour or so it takes to clean up the blood splatter /S
"I don’t know why your comment is downvoted. This is Murphy’s law. If something can happen it absolutely will. If you build a structure where someone can jump in his death, this will happen. Would have been wiser to take this into account beforehand."
"It's down voted because all they had to do was put up vertical barriers AS THEY WERE ADVISED TO DO YEARS AGO and instead refused to take any meaningful steps to prevent the same tragedy from happening over and over again. Designers, architects and owners absolutely have responsibility for the safety of people in the buildings they construct."
"So .. Ok .. people won’t kill themselves when designers, architects and owners build barriers?"
I give up. That doesn’t make any sense to me.
How about fewer people will kill themselves?
You can't stop a jumper with barriers. They'll just find another spot to jump. Period. You're just upset the kid jumped to his death at this particular location.
There's no point in installing seatbelts in cars. People will crash their cars anyway.
"If they want to kill themselves, I guess they won’t use the seatbelts."
"Dude what? The distinction is intent. You can't stop someone that has already made up their mind to end their life. It's a strong sense of dread that they've convinced themselves can only be alleviated by death. Seatbelts are safety installations for accidents and unintentional mishaps on the road. Leave your safe space, face reality, and stop pretending like you know what you're talking about."
""
"Additionally, you really think private businesses want to have people off themselves on their property? You think they don't find that highly inconvenient, traumatizing and bad for business? Why the fuck wouldn't you do the bare minimum to prevent your multimillion dollar vanity project from shutting down permanently in less than 3 years?"
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC415554/
"Yes it's well documented that if the intent is there, they will find whatever is available. If it's not at the fucking Javits center, it'll be somewhere else. But it's convenient for you to bitch on reddit and get upvotes while you pretend to be outraged."
Do you have evidence to back this up? Or does it just feel true?
Someone else used the low walks at the Guggenheim as a comparison. Yet no one has committed suicide there in 60 years.
Lots of things that can happen don't happen. Most things that can happen don't happen.
"This isn’t true. All things that can happen, will happen. It’s only a question of time. Just like genes in the RNA mutate,  nuclear power plants explode, chemicals destroy cities. All these accidents happen accidentally. Why? Because there is a mathematical chance. You only can minimize the probability which in this very specific case would be to build barriers."
"That's just nonsense. That's handwaving vague banality. If you want to learn about suicide you study suicides, not mutation or nuclear power plants. People are more likely to commit suicide in places with a reputation for suicide. The Guggenheim hasn't had one in 60 years, this has had four. Evidence shows that barriers work."
"On this explicit place. Because people visiting a museum are less likely to commit suicide as they have a broader existential sense making their lives intrinsically precious, which is part of their subjective intellectual existence."
You cannot know how many people decided to commit suicide on another place because of barriers.
"My account is 3 weeks old. Was interesting to see reactions from Reddit users, but unfortunately this is not the medium for critical thinking. I cannot change this. To the interested ones: Read something from Kahneman or find some way to educate yourself. And I mean this nice, in a humanistic way. Love & Respect"
Two weeks and all you have is a just so story. And an arrogant attempt at insult.
Electronic_Faith is part of a study.
wow this is so sad. and he was only 14!?
"Only 14 and visiting the vessel with his parents, sister, and grandmother. Utterly tragic."
agreed
Life is an enigma
ohh okay good to know
this thing really has no redeeming values does it
hudson yards is just a giant mall for instagram influencers and rich tourists. the entirety of it has no redeeming value
"When I started my career as an engineer in 2016, I worked there in Hudson yards... I thought I was gonna be working on the greatest project this city has ever seen. It was very lackluster to say the least. Haven't been back there since we finished the project."
Nice bathrooms. That's about it
It's not even a good one. Most of the stores carry reduced stock because their flagships are so close.
"Hey now, Mercado little Spain isn’t half bad. It’s no Jaleo but I’ll take what I can get"
Oh hey I used to work there. I loved the pastries
Well said
"If some people like it then it has value. At the very least it’s a chance for an area to develop into something over decades, find its footing etc."
"Out of all of the takes, this is surely the most tired. Luxury stores and over-blown real estate projects are embedded in New York’s DNA"
Agreed
Where are rich people supposed to shop then? Won’t you think of them for gods sake.
Do rich locals even shop there?
"I'm pretty broke and my girlfriend and I used to pop into some of the cheaper stores in there when we lived a block away. Uniqlo, H&M, and Zara are all pretty affordable."
That's true. I just feel like you'd have to really go out of your way to go there. Those same stores are definitely way more accessible to most people several blocks down on 34th St by Penn
"Oh, 100%. The only reason we went there was because of proximity. But that proximity also increased our rent by about $600 a month so we moved."
You’re broke and you lived a block away from Hudson yards? Cries in the BX
From followup replies
The only reason we went there was because of proximity. But that proximity also increased our rent by about $600 a month so we moved.
That area used to be pretty affordable because it wasn't really near anything. Hudson Yards changed that so we moved.
"It’s possible, but unlikely imo"
That area used to be pretty affordable because it wasn't really near anything. Hudson Yards changed that so we moved.
New York rich doesn't shop there.
"The stores are built for the masses... Uniqlo, H&M, and Zara ain't remotely close to what ny rich shop."
"the pradas, zegna, burberry aren't there."
Online
None. I've seen car garages more esthetically pleasing.
People from all around the world seem to like it
"I dunno, I enjoyed the architecture."
...and some Instagram photos.
w/e.
"Not to defend a silly bunch of staircases, but the safety nets they put up on the Highbridge are made of such thin wire they really aren't obtrusive at all. Of course the architect is gonna reject all visual changes to his work, but this thing is obvs a suicide magnet and needs to be corrected."
"the architect WANTS them to install higher barriers.  it's scumbag MAGA financier/Dophins owner steve ross, CEO of the development company, that's refused to do so....."

Go the fuck to your room.
This has nothing to do with Trump
"It's a character descriptor at this point, akin to ""sleazeball"", ""asshole"", or ""moron""."
"God, stop being such a Trump!"
"this hasnt even really been open when big crowds have been at the javits yet. once they really start packing people into that plaza, this will just happen more, and some will be actual accidents. then you're talkin about lawsuits from people on the ground getting hit and/or having to go to therapy."
"this thing needs to go. no redesign is gonna mentally fix the image thats in peoples heads for this thing now. its not even been open 3 years and this is the 4th, and if they dont permanently close it, its going to keep happening. Especially now that its common knowledge that others have done it there."
"In a city where investment bankers lept to their deaths from skyscrapers, there's a structure seemingly built with the express purpose of killing yourself."
It’s just a bunch of staircases. Why do people flock to it?? Have they not climbed 7 flights of stairs in their lives before??
Doing it for the gram'
"Right by the high line, it takes no effort or thought. perfect for the mindless"
I work as a tour guide and I honestly think it only gets traffic because Hudson Yards gets on its feet to beg Travel Agencies and other marketing vendors to package it with better packages. It’s not a think customers ask for or even really know about.
This has been happening a lot there. Close it down.
Can we at least move the upside down  hornets nest suicide tower thing to Jersey if they are not gunna destroy it?
We don’t want it!!
"Wtf? How about not wanting suicide anywhere. Don’t make it another states issue. we in Jersey don’t want that horrible tourist and death ridden building. And no where else does either but they’re going to have to fix it to prevent this from happening again, or close it to the public permanently."
Alexander Hamilton
Touché.
Everything’s legal in New Jersey.
This is beautiful post
Even the gay guy who commited suicide while attending Rutgers 10 years ago offed himself on the GW Bridge.
No one even wants to die in Jersey.
Twas not my point.
It’s NY’ers favorite past time 😂
Third for me...
Hanging at the local bar with friends
Having a good meal with friends
Hating on Jersey with friends
Hahaha at least it’s top 3
It's an ugly eyesore. A waste of metal. Recycle the thing.
They should demolish it and build affordable condos for millionaires instead.
"Yep, like it's being done  in Downtown Brooklyn  - entire communities being displaced by luxury hi-rises popping up like popcorn everywhere -  for the benefit of the well-off and wealthy."
"But adequate affordable housing for the working class and poor?  Nah, that's just beyond our means!  /s"
This made me chuckle. Thanks.
You’re welcome.
This is the fourth person. It used to be free and now they're charging for extra security- where were they at? He was there with his family- did they have no idea that he was this suicidal? It shows that the new policy of not allowing people to go up alone is pointless. So horrible and sad that his family witnessed this.
"Yeah, it’s definitely not on them at all."
"I visited the Vessel for the first time last week and they had a decent amount of staff, about a person or two each floor."
"You can have a billion staff but if someone made their mind to jump, it's almost impossible to stop it."
There are a few pieces of signage with words and phone numbers to help sway people’s minds who are contemplating suicide. I don’t know if that kind of thing has ever helped anyone. :(
Instead of a giant shawarma why can't we just have a nice plaza with some fucking trees yeesh
or an actual giant shawarma !
I read plaza as pizza...
The developer and architect had a chance to make changes and they didn’t want to mess with the aesthetics. Now they would rather close? It’s better raze it than let it sit there like a tomb.
""
"Either way, I personally don’t care who wants or not to put anything there. The whole thing should be demolished or closed for good or whatever. Is horrible. Pointless. Vain. And ugly."
"Like a lot of folks here, I thought the vessel was ugly before actually seeing it up close and climbing to the top. I went around dusk and it really is nice, Fortunately, I did this before the first closing and visitor restrictions."
please keep this pointless monstrosity closed for good.
Eiffel Tower?
Related companies should be held accountable for rejecting obvious safety measures declared by health and elected officials when it obviously could've prevented these suicides. 4 suicides in 2 years and nothing was done. It is no longer a structural issue but human stupidity issue.
Bulldoze this fucking thing.
It’s going to be closed for good and forever known as a symbol of death to every single person who looks at it.  If the developer and architect want any shred of respect ever again they’ll dismantle it.
Second leading cause of children ages 8-18 is suicide. You know who gives a shit? People who aren’t cunts.
Number 1 is cars and you don't see suburban soccer moms giving up their 3-ton death boxes.
"Number 1 is unintentional injuries, not all necessarily cars. And cars have to have better safety ratings than ever before anyway to minimize death as much as possible."
This is like if you argued against seat belts.
""
"The observation tower. Cars are actively harmful to urban life. Between the danger or crashes, reduced air quality, noise and mental health effects from it, reduction in local business revenue, effects on public health, and the fact that they're just unpleasant to be around, I would 100% rather have a disused observation tower."
""
Even the view sucks though
"""This was totally foreseeable and totally preventable,"" Lowell Kern, thechair of Manhattan Community Board 4, said on Thursday. ""We've met with suicide prevention experts, they've told us this is the best way.Unfortunately, Related followed their own path and now we have a fourth tragedy."""
That is really fucked up.
Why was Related not hit w/massive fines or threatened w/losing its license to operate when its owners refused to install physical safety barriers?
So private companies can dictate to gov't  what they will or won't do  regardless of how their business operations might impact public safety?
"Maybe that oughta change because evidently the private sector cannot be relied upon - with their myopic  ""profit over people"" mindset - to take public safety  - first and foremost - into account in their business decisions."
Take the current climate crises as just one example.
Even as the planet is literally self-destructing before our eyes - as a result of man-made pollution -  the insane owners of the pollution industries want to ramp up drilling for more oil and dig up more coal! Totally nuts!
Truly the blind greed of unregulated capitalism being allowed to operate freely w/o regard for the public weal will ultimately kill us all.
""
Again?
"NYU library used to have open balconies to the lobby floor and students would just jump off. A year later, they finally installed plexiglass barriers"
I actually like this thing and was really hoping to Rocky all the way up. Sad that I dunno when if I'll ever have the chance now.
"So people can post photos on tinder of themselves standing in front of it, apparently."
Capture those breathtaking views of a mall
quickest way for someone to let you know to swipe left
"it looks like a copy and paste job by a high schooler. They'd get an A, for sure, but still a HSer"
I first saw this on a tv show and hated it on sight. Saw it in person for the first time this week and I told my daughter that it gave me bad vibes. She sent this story to me today. So tragic!
"I mean it’s ugly but you can’t ask them to suicide proof the universe. There’s lots of tall things in New York to jump off, if it’s not this it is something else."
"Partially true. But tall buildings with public observatories make attempts to prevent people from climbing over and leaping to their deaths. Those extra few seconds can make a difference. It makes it harder for people to have a ""grand exit""."
"Isn’t the Empire State Building completely caged in? Like, if they have the foresight, there’s no reason this dumbfucks couldn’t. There’s also no reason that there couldn’t be protective netting in between the holes themselves, since you wouldn’t be able to see it in the first place."
"Controversial opinion, but maybe installing safety nets isn’t the way to solve a mental health crisis. A bit of fixing the symptom, not the problem."
"I mean the first time it was reveal, the first thought that came to my mind is how long before they shut it down when people start jumping."
So if people start leaping off the top of skyscrapers are they gonna pull those down too? Sadly if people are determined to end their lives they’ll find a way.
"This is bullshit, FYI. Lots of studies show that access to easy means of suicide increases incidents of successful suicide."
Yeah this is a classic Malcolm Gladwell thing I think. One of the biggest examples was changing oven gas
"Ovens, guns, bridges, and on and on. Like I said, there are lots of studies proving it. That and, if you have two working brain cells, it's pretty obvious."
Not really bullshit. Every building has a roof and most of them have an alarm but by the time anyone can get up there someone can already jump. Many people can even jump out their window. Sad but true.
"Cool story bro, too bad science says otherwise."
"Holy shit, congratulations on your upcoming Nobel Prize for that breakthrough evidence"
Read the article. The 4 suicides have been young people. Young people generally do not plan out the suicide so a physical barrier may prevent the opportunity.
The tops of skyscrapers have 10’ fencing. This ego maniac developer had the means to build nets or fencing and chose not to because it wasn’t aesthetically pleasing.
Fuck that ugly ass thing. It was an eyesore before and now it’s a symbol of death.
What? That’s definitely not a universal (or even common) thing - it’s just been normal balcony height fencing on all the rooftops I’ve been to.
Ok well we are talking about skyscrapers. Not some 4th floor walkup.
Any observation deck on any skyscraper will have high fencing to prevent suicide.
I’m not talking about 4th floor walkups… Do you think a 4 story building is a skyscraper?
"Tourist trap observation decks might have fencing for that, but this is not a general rooftop thing. My building is over 500 feet and has a normal height balcony fence on the roof - as do most roofs like that."
Do you think a skyscraper with publicly accessible rooftops have “balcony” height protection? The only time it may possibly be that height is if there is a landing within 75’ of the roof.
Edit: Way to edit your comment after I responded. Being that this article is referring to a publicly accessible “tourist trap observation decks” that’s what we are talking about.
"This is all in response to ""So if people start leaping off the top of skyscrapers are they gonna pull those down too?"" and you responding ""The tops of skyscrapers have 10’ fencing."""
"If you just meant that The Empire State building, 30 Rock, and The Edge have tall fences, okay, but those aren't all of the skyscrapers in New York, so it was not how I understood that comment. Most rooftops I have been to do not have that type of fencing."
"Just last week, a woman jumped from the roof of a building in Hell's Kitchen. So it's not like suicides don't happen that way."
In the context of this thread we are clearly talking about what’s publicly accessible. I even clarified in my 2nd reply to you.
"You’re trying to change the subject to private roofs tops like that has any weight in the discussion or is related to the article at all.  It’s a publicly accessible installation that anyone was able to walk up to and hop on over. Any other observational point in the city  would have 10’ barriers, and this developer didn’t want to add anything and now another person, a 14 year old kid, jumped to their death. So I stand by my first comment, bulldoze this ugly ass symbol of death."
You can rent a 10th story balcony in the four seasons for about 2 grand.  Best part is if you pay with credit it’s essentially free.
That’s not a public space. That’s like saying you can also rent a car and drive it off a bridge.
The “essentially free” comment did make me laugh though.
The vessel isn’t a public space either. It requires a ticket. Access is regulated by guards.
The one I stayed at didn’t have 10’ fencing. It had a ledge wall that was about 4’. Anyone determined will find a way.
"I am 100% calling bullshit that the top of a skyscraper you were on had a 4’ tall wall, especially if that’s not a private area and accessible to the public."
"That's pretty common, actually. Tons of buildings with rooftop lounges only have waist-high barriers. My friend's building, which is only 20-something stories, but still more than enough to kill someone was about that high, and I've been to tons of rooftop bars with walls of similar height."
A lot of the roof decks on larger apartment buildings just have a waist or chest high wall. Buildings that are certainly high enough to end your life and walls that are not high enough to prevent it.
Can any random person just walk into those buildings and get on the roof?
"NYC apartment buildings are full of random people, AKA the public, living in them. A good percentage of people live in a building that is tall enough to commit suicide off of."
Ok so a random person of the public can just walk in and onto the roof? That’s what you’re saying?
Do you not know the distinction between a private area and a public one?
"The city is made up of random people, and lots of those random people live in those buildings. So yes. Random people have access to tall buildings."
You should be in the olympics with these gymnastics you’re playing.
"They should scrap the metal, sell the land and split the money between the 4 families destroyed because of it."
I’m in the minority here but someone leaping to their death is going to happen anywhere. Should we close top of the rock? What about all rooftop bars? What about the new Edge?
"Point being is that people will kill themselves one way or another. If this was an accident where someone fell over the railings because they’re too low, that’s one thing."
"And for all the people bitching here about it’s a hunk of metal... well it’s a tourist attraction, generates revenue for the local area and local vendors. Everyone here is such a cynic ."
"Do I feel bad for the family, sure. It’s a tragedy and it’s horrible. But if 4 out of 5,000,000 visitors kill themselves I can live with that. It’s an unfortunate tragedy that would happen one way or another ."
"What you said is true but the overall take is to minimize as much options as possible. If it can be done to prevent it, it should have been done."
"A worthless, irredeemable monument to man's arrogance?"
"Jesus fucking Christ, reddit."
"Any way they could move this right on to the river? Even if they close it, people will still try and sneak into it."
Controversial take but making it impossible to commit suicide at the Vessel is not going to stop suicide. If you are committed to killing yourself then you are just going to find another way to do it. People are responsible for their own actions and you can't just suicide-proof the world.
"Source: I personally lost someone to suicide (not jumping, though)"
I dont have any control over other people deciding to end it. If its not here maybe they jumping in front of the train instead. Should we shut the subway down as a result?
"because the subway provides transport to millions of people.  the vessel is a poorly designed piece of instagram art placed in the middle of a mall and given the chance to make it safer and add any safety features, they opted to create a ""buddy system""."
I would never commit not-live because I know my enemies would be smiling over my grave and fuck them
Edit: y’all haters are my motivators 😎
Legalize doctor-assisted suicide and get rid of these stupid barriers. I wanna walk down the Manhattan bridge without looking through a fence.
They really should evaluate the Oculus also. It’s just too fucking easy for some kid to do something stupid or someone in distress to think too quickly. How this shit happens in the most heavily used modern architecture blows my mind.
What in the actual fuck are you talking about
"Wow, you must have really have drunk the propaganda kool-aid by the gallon-full."
Don't you get it!?
It's the other way around! Always has been since forever - it's always been the rich who freeload off the rest of society - it's how the rich (most) got that way!
Don't take my word for it - if you care to - research how many hundreds of billions $$$  (by now trillions) in subsidies (aka corporate welfare) have been and continue to be funneled to the private sector off of the public's dime so that they can profit.
Not to mention the trillions in corporate tax cuts that the working class and poor have to make up for. Sheesh!
you're a jackass
You are very amusing.
"My sister works nearby, she's incredibly shaken up watching them clean everything"
holy shit thats awful. rip
