Ay que sabrozo
Oh my god it really does
you mean a doner kabab?

Doner kebab
"Doner kebab (also d√∂ner kebab) (UK: , US: ; Turkish: d√∂ner or d√∂ner kebap [d≈ìÀàn√¶…æ Ààcebap]) is a type of kebab, made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The outer layer is sliced into thin shavings as it cooks. The vertical rotisserie was invented in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, and doner kebab inspired similar dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Greek gyros, and Mexican al pastor."

It's where they will be hosting the Slinky World Championship.
"I read an article recently about the complex where these buildings reside. Very interesting, much of the city was no pleased with this project and that its just another expansion to the million and billionaire playground and offers nothing of value to the city as a whole. Just another developer cash grab to foreign money."

That is some sensational web design.
Haven‚Äôt seen that good a use of scroll + animation since Apple‚Äôs Mac Pro and the Fire_____ website a game or something I forgot
"I don't get what all the fuss is about, there are many rich only neighborhoods in NYC and other cities around the world. At least here it's open and there are ""free"" non-gated spaces for common folk to enjoy too."
"I'm guessing there must be some views that this camera angle doesn't show us, otherwise I don't really see the point of it?"
"It's an art piece.  It resembles a building, but it's probably better described as a massive sculpture you can walk around on"
"Right. I would hesitate calling it Architecture. It may be architectural, but it‚Äôs mostly a traversable sculpture."
""
"But you could also consider it an architectural folly, which is definitely a thing"
That is true I suppose. Yes it could be considered a contemporary folly definitely.
Tbh the line is naturally quite blurry between architecture and sculpture.
"You realize that what you're saying is that the two get confused on the regular? They can share qualities and they certainly borrow from one another, but the line, itself, is pretty crystal clear"

Richard Serra begs to differ
Why does everything have to have a utilitarian purpose? This is public art.
"I appreciate not everything needs a utilitarian purpose but in my opinion, at least this isn't hugely beautiful, especially not in the finish (though the shape is intriguing) and also, why would people be climbing stairs for no reason at all? This photograph has a fair number of people climbing stairs, which leads me to guess they're taking in views we cannot observe."
"Also, I'm of the opinion architecture is art with purpose, as I see it as a design discipline, so if an entire structure has no purpose, well, it's pointless and I don't see why you'd build it as they'res countless better things that could appear as nice AND serve a function."
"Pictures probably don't really do it justice, same with a lot of art like this. If you were really there and climbing those stairs it would probably be more impressive."
"You ask why people would climb stairs for no reason, yet people are climbing the stairs"
Quoted from me earlier:
I'm guessing there must be some views that this camera angle doesn't show us
"Which if I'm correct, would give a reason for people to be climbing the stairs. A view can in itself be a reason. Why might you put a window where it is? Likely either for light, or for a view."
""
"Yeah, why would random people need to get up and climb stairs in this day and age?"
Think of it as a postmodern Eiffel Tower
"There is no point, it's a bunch of stairs that go nowhere except I guess providing some decent views?"
So...there is a point.
"Not sure about data mining per se, but it‚Äôs already been well publicised that any photo taken of or from the structure is instantly the property of the construction company, to be used as they please (probably for marketing purposes or (more likely) to be sold onto 3rd parties)."
What these 3rd parties will do with this information is more suspect.
unless they make you sign a waiver before entering the building i don't see how it could possibly override current laws for ownership of photos taken by you with your own device.

Expecting Sigourney to show up & blow that alien bitch into space.....
God I hate the Vessel. It just really doesn‚Äôt work for a multitude of reasons. So pretentious.
"You know...I was so ready to hate this thing. But I‚Äôm in NY this weekend and got to go through it yesterday and seeing it engaging people, people taking selfies, kids running up and down the stairs and tiring themselves out, people shouting across the sides to look up and across at each other...it‚Äôs an architectural folly for the social media age."
"I think it actually does engage people and it does add to the urbanism in this case. Again, I was ready to hate it but I think by its nature of being built for the modern digital/social media age it engages the community in its own ways, by simply being a backdrop for social media engagement, in a city where everyone and their brother is an ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù"
"Yes, but apparently none of these people own their selfies. The monument only exists to make rich property owners in NYC money."
"I get what you‚Äôre saying about social media, but at what point does it cross the line between engaging the community and simply existing as a monument to late stage capitalism?"
""
I agree with you; especially regarding the questionable* funding/procurement of this folly.
I‚Äôm not really opposed to it formally; it is intriguing (I haven‚Äôt been there).
I suspect however that the former won‚Äôt hold the test of time as grounds for questioning the structure.
Provided it ages moderately well; I think generations to come will regard it as an Eiffel Tower of our time; without really mattering to them whether its funding contradicted civic values about public space; and about who should decide what can be erected in said public space.
*questionable by my values; whereby public space in the city and its use shouldn‚Äôt be privatised; monetised or reduced to two-dimensional experiences that look good on a social media post.
why are we so concerned with who makes money? can't we just enjoy the fucking thing and take dumb selfies like dumb normal people for no reason?
I feel like if the flat bits were bigger and maybe has some chairs or something it would be the perfect spot for just hanging out. Now it just feels like it's a long staircase.
Lol you sound like the pretentious one. Explain.

"Read this going ""Yep.  Mmm-hmm.  Yep.  Uh-huh.  Yep.""  Got to the end - Kate Wagner, of McMansionHell.  No wonder it was entirely on the money."
What's it pretending to be?
Something akin to the Eiffel Tower or to Big Ben
Weird. People made the same argument about the Eiffel tower and used the great pyramids where you're using the Eiffel tower.
The Eiffel Tower is a testament to man‚Äôs ability to bend and mold iron and steel. It was never meant to be permanent; it was made for the Paris World‚Äôs Fair to stand only as an example of what man can do if he puts his mind to it.
""
"Also, yes, people hated the Eiffel Tower, but for entirely different reasons (it was meant to be temporary, it took up a lot of real estate, it ‚Äúruined‚Äù views, etc). Weird that you would totally make up an example to support your agenda."

"My follow up was simply an observation. I'm an architect, and I have a store of trivia on the subject, so I thought I would share. It wasn't agenda driven."
"My apologies, I misinterpreted your comment as snarky."

"this comment is so pretentious, it looks neat and attracts tourists, thats really its job"
So anticlimactic. There's no payoff
""
That's a generous comparison
great place to take selfies and shop!!!! üòãüòã
"Seriously. To me, it‚Äôs the perfect architectural folly for the social media age"
I‚Äôve only seen pictures but I think folly is the right word for this thing.
Miniquad FPVers dream
It looks like a giant trash bin
Ok lol
"Wasn't there a bloc design like this in fortnite? I hated that too. Actual criticism: seems like a very dull execution. No hanging garden or something aesthetic down the center, just stairs cuz... stairs?"
"I think it‚Äôs honestly meant to engage the social media generation. So many people taking selfies, instagramming and shouting to each other to look across and up at their friends. Also the underside of the ramps is clad with highly reflective copper/brass paneling and actually throws off some very cool reflections/optical illusions when you‚Äôre looking up"
"Yeah, definitely. And serve as an aesthetic to sell property around. I would agree it's very much a set piece, which just seems a poor central design choice for such a large structure in a city with such a minimal amount of land to begin with. The copper does sound cool. I'll have to look for some pictures of that perspective. I'd have to visit to actually have an opinion on the experience but It makes me think of a playground at an adult scale with none of the fun."
I mean there's not even a slide /s
social media generation
Instagrammable spaces. Spaces designed to be instagram worthy. I want to vomit.
"Hey who knows? In the same way that we don‚Äôt really get beautiful spaces/places like Notre Dame and The Hagia Sofia on the same scale and grandeur, maybe some relics of the social media age will be remembered in the same way generations from now..."
What time does it open to the public in the mornings?

Trippy
Quite an aesthetically complex layout of platforms!

I like how they still add an elevator cause it's America
"Reminds me of ""The Institute"" in Fall Out 4"
"Grandiose little bauble, come the apocalypse  I hope it gets turned into a brothel come nightclub and opium den."
"That's funny, but I do have a weird fascination with 'Triumphal Arches'.  Partly begot of studying Ancient Rome, where we don't have nearly as much written down about compared to say, WW2, so you have to study everything you can, and a big part that still survives are the monuments the oligarchs/emperors built for themselves. They generally are made to tell a story."
""
"Then people like Napoleon built them, and there was quite a resurgence post-rennisiance of more of them in Europe.  The Arc de Triumphe in Paris is probably the most famous modern one, and the Monument to the Revolution in Mexico City is even larger an example of the form used in a much different, more modern context."
""
I've fallen in love with the form but that doesn't mean I love what they stand for.
What?
The excitement seems to be over.
