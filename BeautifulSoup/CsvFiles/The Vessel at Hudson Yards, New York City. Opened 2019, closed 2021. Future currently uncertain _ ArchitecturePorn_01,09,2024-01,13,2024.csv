You have my attention
Do people attempt suicide here a lot?
It’s closed because 4 people did
Jeez
one of them was a child too.
The teenager? I believe I was visiting New York with a group of friends and this was one of our destinations but it started raining so we skipped it. Next day walk by it and it’s closed off because a kid jumped.
This is why we can't have nice things.
If only the architects could’ve predicted this! /s
"They closed it temporarily to come up with a solution. The solution was not to let anyone up alone…you could only go in pairs, groups etc. the last kid to commit suicide followed the rules and jumped while his family was with him. Been closed since then."
That’s fucking grim
Yikes
So sad
Alternate reality in Home Alone universe.
"No, they were successful."
It was a tiktok thing to jump off it.

Suicide shawarma
That's my favorite Ozzy song.
This country has lost its goddam mind.
"Do we close the Golden Gate Bridge too? Many more people have jumped there. No. Do we ban the sale of guns, no."
"Oh and ART installation, this must be shut down!"
Insanity. Not to mention it cost $200 million and was enjoyed by many.
"I mean in all fairness for that bridge thing, those actually serve a purpose getting people from point a to b. Art of course has a purpose too but with little to no safety precautions a design like this was just asking for it in today’s society."
"It looks cool, but it was also billed as an observation platform. Which it's not great at because it's surrounded by tall buildings on 3 sides."
And the open view is of New Jersey.
"yikes, as if the story behind The Vessel wasn't sad and horrible enough"
Hence the suicides.
"There's some theories I've seen that it can actually kinda emphasize people's suicidal ideation. Its repetitive and difficult to climb to the top, if you look outward your see urban structures closing in around you and if you look inward you see a spiraling concrete abyss. I've heard people say its a little existential uncomfortable for them to be in."
Its like the Polyhedron from Pathologic...
Hey this apparently serves a very effective purpose of decreasing the population
Doesn't this pass through a thousand suits before it even gets built?
"If someone chooses to jump off something, does that mean it's unsafe, though? I don't think so in all cases, no. I think for this installation, it's more of a choice people are making over a safety issue stemming from an oversight in design."
"Well, the Golden Gate Bridge has other purposes, you see. And a lot of people are upset that we haven’t done anything to curb gun violence."
"But you’re right, we shouldn’t try to stop bad things from happening because bad things happen in other places, too!"
There are many dangerous tourists attractions and hiking spots all over the world that serve no other purpose but being tourist destinations yet nobody thinks of closing access to them. I remember visiting Iguazu waterfalls - on the Argentinian side you go right on top of it and stare into the water falling down - barely a fence there. It’s strangely hypnotic yet hundreds of people are allowed to visit daily.
Argentina isn't the USA
There have been lots of cases of lookout points getting closed off because people fell. It got especially bad once people started the trend of doing stupidly dangerous stunts on cliffs for TikTok or other social media.
Nobody designed natural lookout points. There's different standards for architecture.
Grand Canyon has a low 2ft fence around the rim. You can slip and fall on an icy day and plummet to your death thousands of feet below.
"Me: ""Many lookout points have been closed down, and anyways there's different standards for architecture, compared to natural formations."" You: ""WELL ONE OF THEM HASN'T BEEN CLOSED DOWN! CHECKMATE, LIBERAL!"""
"You sure got me, bud."
They built a wall lol. The wall is not a natural formation.
sigh
"The deadly fall from a cliff is, though."
crying at the comparison between this art installation and one of the 7 natural wonders of the world
"I'm not comparing those, just the approach of whoever is in control of visitors."
"But they’re not comparable. One is a natural phenomenon that has existed for millions of years (and has been visited for at least hundreds of years), and the other is a manmade art installation that was recently created as part of an initiative to make Hudson Yards more attractive to visit/live in."
"It’s not just about reducing harm - it’s also about liability, optics, etc. None of us can say what the contract stipulates for this particular piece but there’s certainly a difference between setting up a fence in an ecological reserve (where changing the landscape may have negative effects), and closing off part of an art installation."
For all we know it’s simply a temporary measure while they decide what to do long term to avoid deadly harm.
"Once again: I am comparing controlling twats in NY to ""hands off"" approach. In other words: if something is legal - as climbing the steps of an art installation is - it should not be banned."
I disagree. It’s almost as if you are implying that the vessel itself killed these people. Suicidal people are responsible for their own actions and the closing of this installation has no affect on their plans.
"Not quite. Tall features like this one with next to no security are highly likely to be the site of impulsive suicides, teenagers are particularly susceptible to this."
"You're right that if someone really wants to kill themselves and plans it out it's hard to stop them. But the sculpture thing does basically nothing to stop it - the railing is too short to stop anyone from climbing over it, which is not the case at the Golden Gate Bridge or most other destination suicide hotspots."
There’s an interesting counter argument with the Golden Gate Bridge safety nets that were just installed. The main argument that people had for the nets was that many people who jumped and survived didn’t attempt suicide again. Many saw the bridge as the only place they’d want to commit suicide too.
A couple interesting papers on the subject

"Well didn’t they install like 8 foot tall acrylic guards or something on the Golden Gate Bridge ? Here they can’t really and as well this was more than an art installation , this was a project/way to increase further more the price of luxury housing and stores as part of a narrative of revitalizing Hudson yards. It was privately funded thanks to extended tax cuts provided to the real estate companies that developed the area, so in my opinion, in a way it was publicly funded because the tax breaks for redeveloping that area left out a key element , anyone who isn’t filthy rich in nyc as the extremely low amount of affordable housing that they where required to do isn’t really affordable (not to mention gentrification of those who where there)"
Nets.  They just installed literal nets.
Well… I guess we did learn something from Chinese slave factories
The guards weren't THAT high. You should still climb over them pretty easily.
Source: We visited the Vessel the day before the last jumper did the deed and it closed. My wife and I were remarking that the security and those plexiglass wouldn't be that hard to jump if you wanted to. Prescient.
"Yeah, but jump off a bridge into water and you’re probably the only witness. Jump off this thing into a crowed NY sidewalk and things are a tad bit different."
"If someone jumps from the bridge during the day, others can see. There is a documentary called ""The Bridge""  about some of the people who have jumped. There is at least one interview with a person who was driving by just as a person jumped."
Watching someone jump into the water is different from someone splattering right next to you
Who enjoyed it?
"When I was in NY you had to pay a fee to enter it, and ""lmao big staircase"" was not something I was going to pay $15 for."
It's art to... what? What emotion is it trying to convey? What is it trying to communicate?
Does it even have a view? I think I remember there being buildings on at least two sides of it.
"River view, I went up when it was free."
Did you enjoy it?
"Yeh , it was OK , not great views but cool because I lived in the area."
The Golden Gate Bridge suicide nets are almost complete...
https://www.police1.com/suicide/san-francisco-installs-nets-to-stop-suicides-off-golden-gate-bridge
"Those jumping off the Golden Gate bridge are unlikely to land on anyone, but from this sculpture the risk must be much higher"
It's almost as if those other things provide additional benefits that an art installation doesn't.
The purpose of this as an art and cultural and economic driver is justified. It has inherit value and worth. Just glad I got to go up in it when it opened.
"A staircase to nowhere does not drive the economy in any way, and driving ""culture"" is arguable as well."
"If you’ve ever been to Hudson yards, yes this thing drew millions of people a year and supplied a non stop flow of tourists to the surrounding retail; it was a key component of the $25 billion dollar development."
I find it very hard to believe that anyone is making a special trip to Manhattan to see this thing.
People would make special trip to that specific area of Manhattan to see the Vessel. I’d definitely go to Hudson Yards to see it.
"i would bet that the golden gate bridge has some kind of net or fence system for this exact reason, and probably has for a long time."
Oh they just built one
"It’s owned by the port authority I believe, probably hard to sue"
They just finished installing a new net under the Golden Gate.
Which I don’t really understand. What’s gunna stop people from just jumping into the netting.. and the. Off the netting?
More people have committed suicide at the Golden Gate Bridge than any other location. over 1400 people by 2012. It is certainly a problem. I am sorry you have so little empathy.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicides_at_the_Golden_Gate_Bridge
One person every 11 seconds commits suicide with a firearm in the United States.
Measures have been taken at the bridge and measures were taken at this structure as well. This is just virtue signaling policy; in reality it does nothing to prevent suicide.
Didn’t they just install massive wire nets on the Golden Gate Bridge? I heard they’re working too.
"Right, in europe it's common for people to throw themselves in front of trains... trains still in use."
Funny just heard a story on NPR that they just spent $200million on a net for the Golden Gate Bridge to stop people from dying when they jumped.
The GG bridge has a (relatively new) suicide prevention net.
We should ban guns. Excellent point.
"Surround it with trampolines and bubble wrap, problem solved!"
Thank you for describing purpose of this thing! /s
Aren’t you glad it was publicly funded ?

Why was it closed down?
Unfortunately 4 people jumped off it. It was briefly closed after 3 and new rules were put in place preventing a single person from entering the structure as well as a cost to enter to help fund further safety measures. It reopened a lil later until after a 4th person jumped. It has been closed ever since. They have recently allowed people to walk inside the middle of it on the ground floor but still prevent people from going up the stairs
One thing I never understood about the decision to close it- are there not plenty of other tall things one could jump off in NYC?
"Honest question, I've been there just once but there's a lot of tall buildings around, I would figure at least a few have outdoor dining, bars, or a viewing platform up high, no?"
"In the endless free time of 2020 I learned a lot about anti-suicide architecture and its implications. Suicide in public spaces is associated with how a person has planned out their demise - there is often a considerable amount of planning for where and how the person will go, what the weather will be, what it will look like and so on."
"In HS and freshman year of undergrad, I became obsessed with the Golden Gate Bridge as a place to yeet myself off of. Researched the hell out of it. Learned that there is a volunteer org dedicated to identifying potential “jumpers” in addition to a perpetual police presence."
The Golden Gate has been working on installing a metal net to catch would-be jumpers and just about every city/state will have their own “hot spot(s)” where people will attempt to end their life from.
Other fun fact for you then: I knew a woman who worked as a maid at one of the hotels right opposite the bridge from Emeryville. She said people killed themselves with pills there all the time for the same reason.
"The bridge is such a shitty way to go. A bunch of your bones break and you drown, flailing frantically in ice cold water with your broken limbs."
"OMG, talk about nightmare fuel 😳"
That and at least some survivors of the jump say they changed their mind once it was too late and they were already falling :C
"to quote bill burr's famous helicopter bit,"
"""OMG THIS IS WORSE!!!! THIS IS SO MUCH WORSE!!! 😭😭😭"""
"That's the title of what I've heard is one of Bojack Horseman's most emotional episodes: ""The view from halfway down"""
Yep. I saw the guy talk who survived the jump. It was an amazing yet so sad story. Glad he lived.

This is interesting.
"But more importantly, are you ok now? Sticking with us I hope? :) 🤞🏼"
"Im fine, it was the guy above who had the suicidal ideation. But thanks!"
Oops!  Glad you’re ok anyway :)
I work in the Coast Guard. I have some friends that have been stationed in San Francisco. The stories are crazy and sad.

"I'm glad that they installed the suicide nets, even if it took 91 years to do so."
I worked on an oil tanker that went under that bridge regularly. There were jumpers all the time. One time someone jumped just moments before we passed under it. I didn't see them but security on the bridge threw flares into the water to help the USCG rescue boat determine where the current would most likely take the body.
We took on pilots and one of them told me they averaged a jumper every 3-4 days. That really blew my mind.
That was always my worry going under the bridge. Thankfully never experienced anything like that on our transits.
Why not just close the pedestrian access
"Because the Golden Gate bridge is iconic and is used by thousands of people every day to walk and ride bikes across, whether it be for work or just fun. It's an incredible experience walking across it. It's a loooooong way down. People who jump really want to die."
Just a few years ago they started putting up nets to catch jumpers. I believe that project has recently finished.

"Do you think that the nets will genuinely be a deterrent for suicidal people? I saw them on pictures and, tbh, they looked kinda underwhelming. I can’t imagine that a committed jumper would be hindered by those nets."
""
"Makes sense 👌. I still think that the nets could have been designed in a more effective way, but I’m no expert."
"commitment to suicide is a tricky thing.  many people have second thoughts after jumping, according to survivors"
"Actually there was a news article the other day about it. They're getting close to finishing the net, and during installation they had a handful of people try to commit suicide and land in the net. Some of them climbed back up, others got up and just took another jump off the net to their death..."
The net was actually just completed
"Check out the documentary ""The Bridge"" if you haven't already. Very sad but morbidly fascinating."
Barenaked Ladies' song War on Drugs mentions a net installed on the Prince Edward/Bloor Street viaduct in Toronto.
"That net was used as a "" military bunker entrance "" scene in one of the resident evil movies"
"That documentary includes some survival stories and though I've never been suicidal, hearing from someone who tried and survived say that as soon as he let go as he jumped, he realized everything wrong in his life was fixable except for what he'd just done... it was really powerful."
Damn survival instict... Why you gotta kick in just when it's too late.
I've seen where a majority of survivors say that they regretted it as soon as they let go
"It's the most depressing suicide statistic in my book. You jump, realize how badly you fucked up, and then it's still a very, very long way down."
Incredible documentary
Thanks for the recommendation
They just finished it a few days ago. Like jumping into a razor they describe it
"To shreds, you say?"
What a strange concept.  Making an anti-suicide net that is implied will intentionally hurt people.
Not intentionally hurt- you just can’t build a long lasting “net” any other way?
Not in a salty foggy damp area like that. Everything rusts really quickly out there if it's not protected. (I live nearby.)
"these anti-suicide sentiments are always about keeping you alive at all costs, they never care about what pushed you to that point or how your life may be ruined afterwards"
fr suicide prevention is a joke. No one is going to actually help you so they should just cut out the self-righteous bullshit.
so they'd be sliced to bits?
No- just in the hospital with scars and a reminder.  They said they are thick steel cables not rope so the 20’ fall into them is going to ruin your day.  BUT your alive
Neat
"Not a huge Malcom Gladwell  fan, but he had some interesting stuff about suicide and mentions the Golden Gate Bridge as an example. From what I can remember: they closed the Golden Gate Bridge to repair it, and suicide rates dropped. Apparently they way you commit suicide is just as important as the act itself."
They just finished building the net!
""
The net is completed now..
https://amp.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/jan/03/golden-gate-bridge-suicide-prevention-net-completed
I heard this volunteer org on golden gate suicide prevention was founded by someone who jumped and survived. He/she started the org because after jumping he/she realized that she wanted to live.
"One of my local hot spots (NY) is the Kingston Rhinecliff Bridge. It’s high over the Hudson with low guide rails. Beautiful views, but it’s best seen from inside a moving vehicle because of next to no amenities on either side and continuous crosswinds. It’s been a jumper magnet since it opened in the 50s, and when the wind is up it’s an unsettling experience even in a heavy vehicle. You get on the bridge, and your first instinct is to get across the thing as soon as possible. It’s safe, but it’s never going to feel safe."
"Knowing all that, in their eternal wisdom, the state decided that what the bridge needed was…a pedestrian walkway and bike paths, shoehorned into the existing travel lanes."
Let’s review the results:
"more jumpers, because now it’s easy to park and go out on the walkway if ending things is the plan"
"virtually no pedestrians (not counting jumpers) even on beautiful days, and an unusable walkway when the weather’s bad. Good luck plowing a four foot wide walkway with barriers on both sides, and snow from the travel lanes being pushed onto it"
virtually no cyclists except a tiny number of hardcore long distance riders…who use the pedestrian path because it’s almost always empty
more crashes because vehicle lanes are several feet narrower
bigger traffic backups because now the crossing experience is that much more dangerous both in perception and reality.
"And now, the capper."
"Because of the increase in jumpers, the state installed more signs for a mental health hotline. All is not lost, call this number."
The signs are in a cellphone dead zone.
This is interesting.
"But more importantly, are you ok now? Sticking with us I hope? :) 🤞🏼"
The netting on the GG Bridge was FINALLY installed as of yesterday
That’s very interesting. Do you think eliminating these “suicide hotspots” would lower suicide rates at all?
Inside the NYU library was a popular spot for a while. Took serious effort to fix it.
"Lots of places with roof access or fire escapes, but you need to know someone who lives there. NYC windows are even deliberately hard to get out of. Anything publicly accessible is suicide proofed."
I was just thinking about the NYU library. Is it true they designed the floor to discourage jumpers from following through?

"that is what I was told when I was there in early 90's. At the time, the full height screen barriers you see today did not exist"
"I always wondered how much truth there was to that. I was told the same, but... we aren't cats. How did they really expect that to work?"
to your point I highly doubt the architectural designer came up with the floor pattern with THAT in mind. most likely a story made up to tell during orientation! 😅 However the full height screen cover (over the original railings) were designed to prevent jumpers.
"Agreed. The screens are really nice looking, I thought it was a tasteful approach."
There's a few morbid videos out there documenting the gistory of suicides and new architecture. It really isn't a new thing.

"Lots of tall buildings but most roofs and access to outside is locked down, so you need to really be determined, and find a way. The difference here is that to get to the place is you will need to walk by ridiculously rich stores and places well out of most people’s means. Then when you get there just lots of steps, like a hamster wheel, perhaps a reflection of the working life. Once you are up there there is nothing between you and the open air, the railing isn’t even particularly high. It is like a warm invitation to a person having a bad day. I have been there but it has never been opened to climb. My work can involve roofs throughout the city, so I know something about that.  Not a shrink but that is how it is seen by many."
dude no you don't lol. its really easy to get on roofs in nyc. have you ever been?
"Residential buildings are easy, that is true. I’m thinking more of the commercial buildings."
"Because you can't actually find a place to jump easily in NYC despite the many tall buildings. You see when something heavy like the human body comes plummeting down from 10, 20, or a 100 stories it causes quite a bit of damage. So that shit gets locked down. In this case there were many groups of people complaining about this ugly-ass $200,000 million dollar pinecone, not just because it was hideous and expensive and did not have proper access for the disabled. No, they knew right from the start the railings were way to low and both the real estate dick and the architect responsible for the creation of the ugly monstrosity ignored them."
"I remember watching a documentary about it but couldn't begin to know what source, heh."
This was seemingly more accessible
I think any building over 3 stories high. From the roof or out a window.
"So studies were taken in the 1990s and it discovered that believe it or not, suicide is an act of opportunity, not of volition."
"When access to methods of suicide are removed, suicide rates go down overall. Common thinking would believe that someone would just find another way to kill themselves, but it doesn't appear to be that way."
"When gas stoves were replaced with electric ones for example, suicide rates plummeted."
"The easier it is to commit suicide the more likely someone will do it, and the harder it is, the more they will decide not to."
I'm aware of this... what I was asking about was other places in NYC.
"Yeah, the Westfield Mall at WTC comes to mind"
"The beauty and symbolism of the structure itself probably made it appealing. The below paper talks about survivors of suicide attempts at the Golden Gate Bridge, all of whom said they would only have commit suicide there."

Well that’s incredibly depressing.
It is quite unfortunate
Tragic
There’s a similar thing where I live cashed the Malahat skywalk. You go up the ramp and you’re way up in the air. They have full time counselors hanging out at the top to make sure no one is making permanent choices.
"If I remember correctly, the 4th death was someone who talked their family into going with them, knowing they wouldn’t get in alone. Very sad."
"Fuckin christ...just make the rails 8-10 fr tall. Boom, problem solved"
They never closed the Golden Gate Bridge…. At least now it has nets now I think.
The Golden Gate Bridge serves a utilitarian function this doesn’t. It’s a grim cost benefit.
"I know, but my point was more they did not do shit to even try to do anything about it until many groups and documentaries were made about it."
Yeah it’s really sad also like what is going on in our society that is driving people to this level of despair where they feel compelled to choose suicide ? We can keep putting up all the nets and railings we want but it’s not gonna solve the real issue
Unfortunately I am not smart enough to figure out that issue.
going on in our society that is driving people to this level of despair where they feel compelled to choose suicide
Suicide isn't new...  The brain is just a pile of meat with electricity running through it.  Of course it malfunctions sometimes.
"there have been a sharp increase in suicide and “deaths of despair” in this country. The meat in your head is connected to and molded by the world around it through perception, Language, culture, etc. We’re not brains in a vats. We can strive to create a world that makes the meat in our heads more likely to thrive and less likely to “malfunction”"
Not wanting to live shouldn’t be considered a “malfunction”. Life is shit for a lot of folks.
Not wanting to live shouldn’t be considered a “malfunction”.
"A base instinct of ALL life is survival.  Wanting to actively kill oneself IS a ""malfunction"" and a medical emergency every bit as much as cancer.  Something is going very wrong and that person needs medical treatment.  It is also supported by the fact that most who end up failing in suicide and getting treatment subsequently end up living."
Life is shit for a lot of folks.
"JFC.  People ate insects and sucked moisture out of dirt in concentration camps to survive instead of offing themselves.  ""Life is hard in San Francisco"" is a fucking low-bar for justifying suicide as a rationale function of a normally-functioning human brain."
"What a load of bullshit. People don’t need medical treatment for having had enough of life, and they certainly don’t need to have suffered through the worst possible conditions in order to reach that conclusion."
It's only closed for safety during extreme weather when the bridge deck is bouncing up and down too much. It's only happened a few times.
Could they not have built high or even enclosing glass walls the way most other similar structures do?
""
I'm sure lowering cost had something to do with it
“Suicides no longer allowed on the premises.”
"Wait, you tryin' to tell me they designed a high building without safety measures usually prescribed for high buildings?"
Safety measures? You get that this is people committing suicide right?
"they have anti-suicide architecture, primarily because the plummeting bodies are liable to kill people on the ground along with themselves"
https://www.fastcompany.com/90665053/learning-from-the-vessel-how-cities-can-be-designed-to-prevent-suicide
"Many tall buildings legitimately have ‘suicide nets’ a story or two down from the top. That and, y’know… unclimbable/tall rails, etc. Not saying a sufficiently determined person couldn’t beat these measures, just that they exist."
"Interesting point, and it makes me beg the question why it wasn't included? Was it even thought about? I'd like to know."
Unfortunately yes. They could land on somebody. The family could sue the owners. Children could fall. Once you become known as the suicide/accident machine then it will only get worse. Then nobody legitimately wants to go there.
You know what they say about hindsight. My guess is they didn't want to obstruct the view too much unfortunately it turned out to be a bad decision
they should re-open with the entire structure surrounded by foam pits
Hopefully the incompetent architects that designed it were closed down too.
"Why? It meets code. The guardrails are 42"" high which is what code requires."
"If you want to blame someone, petition to have the international building code revised. Because nearly every city in the US uses a version of it and has this exact same regulation."
"There are thousands, maybe millions of buildings where you can jump off and kill yourself. All you need is 3 stories."
I don’t see the problem…
"Just cordon off an area so they can't land on any innocent bystanders and nobody has to see them splat, paint a big red target with a police silhouette in the middle so they know where to aim, and let em have at it."
Throw in a couple fake TV cameras just to make sure they this is the spot.
Now we can take all the stupid nets off the GWB so I can enjoy the view while riding across.
a cost to enter to help fund further safety measures
Lmao...
Why don't they just make the railings higher?
"Maybe unpopular opinion, but this is a stupid reason to close something. People who want to check out should not influence where I can or can’t go."
That’s so sad. They should build a small office there and turn it into a walking round the clock suicide clinic. Get volunteers to walk the structure and be a resource for those who are hurting. This thing has unfortunately gained some significance as a symbol of suicide but that need not be where it ends and it need not be a solemn legacy.
"People got depressed over the economy, the fact that interest rates are so high, housing prices are so high and the fact that the private equity companies and trying to buy all the single family homes so that no one can own anything anymore. Gas is expensive, food is expensive. People used to be able to raise 10 kids on a single working parent working for Coca-Cola…. Now both parents need to work to maybe have a kid or two. Student debt for useless degrees, stagnant wages, the hollowing out of the middle class. This stuff gets people depressed and then they jump. Plus you can drink the water or breath the air without getting cancer, but don’t worry if you sign up for a subscription they can mitigate your symptoms rather than cure them."
"You have clearly never met my cousin Peter. Expensive gas, food and housing are buzz words. Economy, buzz word. Student debt, totally not real. Cancer, fake news."
Yes he would be better if he jumped off a skyscraper and joined Jesus in the sky.
Ok you explain why people are killing themselves
"Thanks, that's the dumbest thing I've read today."

"It’s a really pretty thing, and I think it’s wonderful to have spots you can get a nice view from in the city without having to work in tall buildings. It must be terrible for everyone involved that people have found an incredibly discouraging use for it outside of art."
"I dont feel like this is high enough to give you a good view of the city, sadly.  There is something like this on top of the Reichstag in Berlin which was really cool"
"My dad got tickets for the opening day, and we went up. You get a great view of the rail yards and the buildings in a 2 block radius. The river view isn't bad, but it has about a 45° FOV that isn't blocked by buildings on that side"
Yeah it’s kind of in a huge courtyard.
"To see in the direction on the other side, you have to pay $50 to visit The Edge. Which is a tourist trap but, to be fair, has a hell of a view and a fun elevator."
"I used to work in the building right next to this and this really isn't high enough to give you good views of the city. But beautiful structure regardless, unfortunate that it had to be closed."
"It’s hideous and the only thing it overlooks is Hudson Yards, a monument to developers that couldn’t care less about affordable housing and anything the city actually needs"
Edit: fixed typo ;)
*Couldn't care less FFS
You’re right and people on reddit are consumerist dorks
idk why theyre downvoting u for being right. hudson yards is so idiotic
Maybe they’re big fans of Sonic Sphere? That and The Shed is some of the worst art and music curation I’ve seen in the entire city
"Yeah I’m assuming you’re being downvoted by people who don’t know the whole tragic story about this development. It’s a monstrosity, and only happened through grift and corruption."
"You are correct, so of course you are downvoted, it's the reddit way.  At one point I'm only going to trust downvoted comments about something I'm not knowledgable about as they seem to be more and more consistently correct."
"I’ve never heard someone say that, I truly hate it and find it to be horribly designed and horrible to look at I work by the equinox Hotel maybe once a week and I go admire it and I would definitely use it for the same reason they do"
Yike
I find it nice
It looks like a piece of shit cut in half
Unfortunately any possible view of the city is blocked by the shopping mall they built next to it. Which also cuts off Hudson Yards for pedestrians at street level- kind of a surprising design mistake to still be making in the 2010s/20s
The suicide shwarma
The Marriott Marquee in NYC had the same problem.  They have since erected barriers to prevent self defenestration from happening.
I was wondering about those. They are quite ugly but now I see the reason
"Has any architectural structure ever been unbuilt solely because of the ""lets jump off it and kill ourself"" suicide risk?"
"What a sad, dystopian moment this is."
""
They obviously didn’t have any Late Millennial/Gen Z design staff on that project our depressed asses would have caught that issue immediately.
It is unfortunate. As cruel as it seems I think they should of left it open cause I mean this sort of stuff does happen unfortunately
Put up a rollercoaster snap cam.
Play the Smiths non stop on speakers
Third Eye Blind?
Motorcycle drive by till someone jumps
It's still open the last time I was there in July last year. You just can't go up after a level or so.
Well I just mean the structure as a whole basically is closed. Sure you can still walk in it at ground level but the main purpose of it was to walk around it. Hopefully they'll be able to open it fully in the future
"What are the odds capitalist society will get more supportive of humanity, less encouraging of self destruction?"
Or the odds that we find a way to structure our society away from capitalism?
Why? Are you looking to put some action on that? I will take the other side.
Was just a response to
Hopefully they'll be able to open it fully in the future
Nobody wants to bet on humanity at any odds!
"We went a few weeks ago. There was a queue. I thought “hey, neat it’s open!”  Nope. Line to walk into the lowest level and look around from the inside. Nothing else to do. Lame and unfortunate."
Then I learned why it’s closed and it really killed the mood.
What did they charge for that if anything? It was like 20 bucks to climb before
"It's free to go into the ground floor portion, they just limit the number of people that can go in at one time."
"Interesting, at first it was free"
"Shit, I didn’t know they charged to walk it. Makes sense I guess. I thought I read something where they described it as sort of a vertical park, so I maybe just assumed it was a public thing."
"What a shame it closed, it was really cool to visit. And it’s much higher/bigger in person."
"If you build it, people will find a way to kill themselves on it."
total waste of money.
Instead of closing it because of suicides they should install trampolines and a scoreboard
"Make the area around it like Top Golf, and people can jump in different places for better scores."
Honestly just let it go. It adds to the bleak feeling that is Hudson Yards.
They once called the area “Death Avenue”
That wasn’t anything to do with the Shawarma though.
I agree. When I visited it had such a weird somber vibe. Idk. I'd prefer to see it gone
The whole area reeks of soulless corporatism.
Can't people jump off any tall building? Why would you close down this one?
This had open access without accountability - it was a vertical park.  In most buildings there are at least some obstacles prohibiting access (I.e. a locked door.)
"Its location was attractive to attention seekers, as well."
They should consider closing down mountains with steep cliffs as well.
"Having climbed my whole life, not too many suicides that way.  It’s not simply about the height alone, it’s the spectacle part.  This, as others have said, is art.  Early skyscrapers had lots of jumpers - it was a statement that would be seen and documented.  Jumping off a cliff - you risk never being found."
"You also have to go way out of your way from a lot of places to jump off a cliff. This was basically a tall staircase in the middle of the city, with a subway stop right next door."
Mountains aren't designed by human beings who feel guilt for enabling suicide
"This is in the largest city in the world. An enormous number of people have access to it, unlike taking a trip out to the mountains."
This is in the largest city in the world. The suicides are much more visible.
I went to the Grand Canyon once. The visitor center had a book of all the known deaths at the canyon. It was not a thin book. Im sure a large number of the deaths were dumb accidents.
"I didn’t have a lot of time other than look at the canyon around the visitor center area. But from what I could see, so many people acted like they were safe and I saw some pretty stupid stuff."
"I’m not saying to close it, but they did have way too many bars cases and things to keep as many as possible from being dumb."
"Here’s the thing: no one will argue that these suicides aren’t tragic. But as long as NYC has subways there’s an equally hideous, even more widely available way to snuff yourself…and people use it often enough that the hate this skeletal pinecone gets for “irresponsibly provoking” such acts is obvious nonsense."
People are just easy and simple minded to resist the facile and reductive idea that it’s somehow the architecture’s fault.
"Suicide is a waaaay different, waaaay bigger problem than the place it happens. Well meaning people too often get overeager to stop something bad by convincing themselves their flawed answer is “good.”"
"Re-open the structure, but clear the walking paths beneath it. No one in NYC has suggested closing the subways."
"Facts. Alternatively, they could also replace the glass railing with higher glass panels that cannot be climbed over."
"I don't think you're wrong about the fact that suicide is a larger issue, but from a public policy perspective it's bad when you realise you gave planning permission to public infrastructure that becomes seen exclusively as a suicide device. Subways have a purpose other than jumping off the platform, whereas the design of the Vessel makes it impractical as a public space but perfect as a suicide spot, like a weird trampoline."
"Maybe I'm biased because I always considered the installation pointless, decadent and a monument to property developers."
“Seen exclusively as a suicide device.”
"It’s cool for you to dislike it, but you can’t just state an absolutely false fact as you have without getting corrected."
Lots of folks think it’s cool art as shown by the number of visitors. The fact it’s been an easy platform to dive off doesn’t make its “only” function to Kevorkian the depressed.
"So you’re claiming it’s a suicide provocation for the neighborhood locals then, if I’m hearing you right."
""
"That’s your claim above, right?"
"Not that a flying body part from a subway hit can’t take out others on the platforms, but I think the fear is that someone lands on someone else."
Seems that the issue is understandable horror by compassionate people who hate the idea a suicidal person will kill themself there.
""
"The fact many such kindly, well-meaning folks mistakenly blame the structure rather than alleviate any part of the real problem means their efforts fall short despite them feeling they’ve accomplished something and stop."
"Ahh the suicide kebab , graciously publicly funded for the pleasure of the rich"
Tear the goddamn thing down if it's that much of a problem.
The owner of the site has considered it. Personally I would hate to see it torn down. Hopefully they can come up with an alternative solution
how bout raising/adding more glass panels?
I believe it was discussed as a possible solution. But either cost or the added weight makes them hesitant
Last I read this was going to ruin the architects vision so they did not agree to it
Howard Roark over here
One would think so but who knows
What is it?  An exercise device?
It's a series of interconnected stairs for people to climb around. It was designed after Indian Stepwells
7 more replies
"Close, suicide device"
Demolish it and place a good old statue in the spot.
What about charging admission by appointment?
Very chill spot. Me and my girl had a nice date there
This architecture true crime tho
"Was there a couple of months ago, fantastic to see a shame we couldn’t go up it. It’s also about 200 yards from the viewing platform that’s about 10 times higher"
I’m glad I had a chance to go up and the sense not to jump down.
Closed?
Unfortunately people can no longer walk up the various levels anymore after 4 suicides. People can now only walk into the middle area on the ground level
It will be a matter of time we hear rumors about tearing it down. Surely could be a good tax write off for those developers
“So what would you say you DO here?”
Used to love this but once My friend called this “art for arts sake” and I can’t get that outta my head.
"It's a shame - I enjoyed going up there in 2019, it's really cool."
I've thought tacky high-tech structures was the Chinese domain.
"We have something pretty similar up in BC, but it's def open.  No one has jumped off of it to the best of my knowledge."
https://malahatskywalk.com/
That looks cool!
It’s unique. I like it
I saw it in person back in 2022 and it was kind of underwhelming. The fact that everything was closed off and you couldn’t really explore it due to multiple suicide attempts made it even more disappointing.
I’m glad I got to experience The Vessel before they were forced to close it.  It’s amazing.
I'm jealous. I wish I had gotten the chance to visit it before it closed
Likewise. Went here twice when it first opened and really enjoyed it! There is something Giger-esque about the central lifts as well. I took some really fun tilt shift lens shots on my second visit. I really hope they find a solution to allow it to fully reopen. I know it's controversial amongst locals but it's in a shopping and office district so it's harming nothing residential. As a tourist attraction it was/is brilliant.
"I was entirely underwhelmed.  Wait in line, walk up some stairs… and? It’s not a great view, it’s high but not that high."

Avoiding Suicide Architecture ...
https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/472259
Imagine if they closed down every building or place that someone has committed suicide at.
"Or as I call it, the Suicide Shawarma."
I was able to climb it shortly after it opened and it was a cool experience. Its nice to be able to interact with the art rather than just look at it from afar.
Sucks that it's closed now. Hope they can fully reopen it at some point in the future. Some minor fringe unfortunate cases shouldn't ruin it for everyone IMO.
That must of been cool. I had hoped to visit it one day and climb it myself. I'm hoping they'll reopen it one day
Why did they close it ?
Sadly 4 people jumped off it
I’ve always wanted to visit and go up it 🥺
Looks like the conveyor belt tornado that let's game it out built in satisfactory
"I dot know, I haven’t ever seen a structure I’d like to jump off then I have just now."
"Why can't it be retrofitted to have taller glass that cannot be climbed upon, and reopened to the public? Maybe even for a ticketed price?"
It looks like those alien ships that Thanos sent to NY in the 2012 film.
Ah a Heatherwick.
Urban hell
When I first saw this thing it was still under construction. I thought it would be the interior or something of another skyscraper. What is the point of this building?
It was built as an interactive public art piece. People were able to walk up the various levels
I bet if they put a single functional purpose at the top the phenomenon would peter out.
200 million for a suicide stairwell and no one saw it coming.
"Is this also the building you weren’t allowed to photograph? Otherwise, you’d be sued? Or was this just a made up story?"
You could photograph but the attraction had the right to use your photos if they wanted basically. It did receive backlash and was eventually removed
I thought of going up this once but I was busy. Wish I had.
"They probably could add nets and reopen. Or guided tours, while everyone is chained to the tour guide."
"Glad I got to visit in 2019, cool building ... except for all the murder & suicide"
What about people who jump from tourist destinations -- those don't get shut down...
"There have been about 91 suicides in the Grand Canyon, with jumping off the ledge being the most common method. But there have been 13 times when someone drove their vehicle off the ledge. Three of these occurred in one year, 1993.  (reported Sep 19, 2023)"
They need to open it back up.
"Out of total luck, we visited NYC in 2019 and walked on the Vessel the day before the suicide and it was closed for good."
"Why is it a problem for an adult to commit suicide? If you don't want to be on Earth anymore, leave. Why force someone to continue to live an existence they consider miserable. It's THEIR life to do what they want with.  If you get therapy and it doesn't work, feel free to off yourself. In immense pain daily, dying of a horrible disease, whatever, you should get to commit suicide!"
"\There should be official assisted-suicide centers and specialists, too, so you don't do it in a public place or kill other people by accident on your way out.  Humans are pieces of ish most of the time and unfortunately it's difficult to live in complete isolation. May be a better state of being once you go through death's door. Or not. But it should be your choice to leave or stay."
Unfortunately one of the 4 people that killed themselves was a 14 year old boy. Otherwise I do agree that if someone doesn't want to live anymore that's their own choice. Just please don't harm anyone else during the process
i went on it while it was briefly open. stupid fuckin structure shouldn't exist
I called it on day one.
"To my eyes it occupies the site. It's ""Hey, look at me"" and serves no use for humans to live better in the city, like a basketball court with food trucks surrounding it under a shady grove of trees with benches waiting to be polished by the multitude of interesting backsides. Think that's not so cool, and so passe, then you are so lucky."
pretty dumb idea
Oh? Why did they close the stairs kebab? Suicides?
Unfortunately yes. 4 people jumped off it
I know it will make it ugly but why not add windows of steel nets so that its still open yet noone can jump?
They did add a section of wire fencing enclosing the gaps to see what it would look like. It certainly did detract from the appearance but the section was removed and nothing has happened since. Unfortunately I don't think they want to spend all sorts of money so it's better to just keep it closed in their opinion
Cool! 150 million tossed down the drain.
Just install a safety net at the bottom. Problem solved.
"What like 3"" above the pavement?   How would that fix anything?"
big ass ball-pit moat
Make jumping off of it the actual point.
Have you ever visited the circus?
Raise the glass fence by 4 ft and add barbs at the top
This: Just floor to ceiling glass.
It’s open. I walked in it
You can currently walk in the middle of the ground floor but the stairs themselves aren't open for people that climb anymore
"WTF is this, a bridge to nowhere?"
It was built as an interactive public art piece. The intention was for people to walk up and down all the different flights of stairs and take in the view of the surrounding development
"So, yes, a bridge to nowhere."
Well technically a staircase to nowhere
"Pretty wild that everyone saw the suicide situation coming a mile away, years before this opened- and yet they still went ahead with it"
What a terrible symbol of waste and poor decisions.
who but everyone could have imagined that a stairway to nowhere would be doomed to failure
"It’s not closed, you can still go in the bottom and look up. I was there not a month ago."
For a stair sculpture that feels closed.
My car isn't broken I'm sat in it now it's just that the engine doesn't work.
You may be able to walk in the middle of it and look up but the structure itself is closed. You used to be able to walk up all the different levels. After the suicides they closed off access to the stairs
For what purpose?
It was built as an interactive art piece where people could walk up the different levels
Ooooh. Thanks! I think it’s pretty.
No problem. I think it's pretty too. I hope one day they'll reopen it fully
I worked building the building just next to it.  I was on the 6th floor and saw the last guy who jumped get covered up by the nypd.  Fun times.
I was there last week!
"In New York, you don’t think small…How about we add the world’s biggest Pillow park surrounding it?"
And it was closed for the pandemic for a few of those months.
"Rename the artwork to ""A Monument to the Woeful State of Mental Health Care in the United States""."
Done.
Why is this place so prone to jumpers? Any building would do. Is it more of a spectacle?
""
"""I know the pieces fit..."""
I climbed it in 2020 and the walkway flooring was sketchy feeling.
Why do people gravitate towards suicide when going here?
I’m hoping it opens up again because it’s really awesome to walk up. I was lucky to be able to go before it closed for the final time.
Oh man I went back to NY to visit in 2019 and went to the top of this thing.  I had no idea it got closed down.  I wonder if I took any pictures while I was up there
"I went up in it! It was really cool! The view was neat, and it was fun to walk around in. I didn’t know it closed. :("
"I went to the top level back in 2019. It wiggled, kinda freaky."
"I can't believe anyone hasn't mentioned it yet, but why not try the Foxconn solution?"
You need additional pylons.
Did someone shit in it?
"Wild idea, put padding around the base, not only would it save lives (probably not all) it would at least disincentivize using it as a place for suicide. And let’s be honest, those people were going to find a way regardless."
Professional Tinder background
Ridiculous structure. Completely  useless.
Why didn't they make the guardrails higher??? Ffs
Absolute blight on the city
This useless structure no one asked for.
Damn suicide engine was efficient beyond its creator's wildest expectations.
I feel like they weren't creative enough with solutions to stop jumpers. Like those balcony safety nets or really tough plexiglass/ glass. Maybe its a financial thing and just wasn't worth the effort?
Lot of stairs. Loses its luster pretty quick. They made a lot of money from charging people to reserve times and such.
The ROACH!
r/suicideporn
They should rename it Hubris.
"Been up it several times, nice river views."
Hi
Thought this was a screenshot from satisfactory as I was scrolling past
"As if it wasn’t hazardous enough, I cut my hand on a section of sheet metal on the hand rails which wasn’t deburred."
"Having walked to the top a few times during the pandemic it was really amazing when it was empty. Later on it got crowded, and a lot of annoying influencers ruined the experience at the summit. Not to mention the ridiculously long line of people without tickets. To be honest, the guardrails felt a little short when I was up there, but I didn’t care because the view was really nice. For a structure like this, I have no idea how suicide prevention was never brought up by code officials. I think it looks nice in its context, and wouldn’t like to have it torn down. However, knowing the future plans for this specific part of town they might as well tear it down and install a Ferris wheel or some other gimmicky attraction to bring people into the Casinos."
Great way to keep it and reopen in the long term would be to raise the height of the glass from the walkways.. focus on looking through the glass and not over a hand held railing. Won't be the same but will nonetheless be enjoyable.
Worst example of soulless modern corporate art ever...
""
I got to tour this when it was open. Pretty cool.
Looks like an M.C. Escher design.
Could be bad Feng Shui. I wonder if anyone has been looking into this.
When are people going to realize living in a city like new York is not healthy and makes people suicidal?
I say get rid of it.
My daughter was the Security Manager for the Hudson Yards and had to secure the area after each jumper.  She had enough and moved to a different department. Way too stressful.
Just take the L.
Add acrylic walls or something to prevent the tragedies.
Take that abomination down
