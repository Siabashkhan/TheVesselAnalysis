"In the sculpture designers defence they just can't see that coming, people with mental health issues unfortunately maybe found it convenient."
Wow. That is a beautiful and innovative sculpture.
Only reason I went back to NYC last year. It is truly awesome.
"Someone does not get the idea to jump as they are walking up. They DON'T get near the top and think ""oh the rail is nice and low, I could jump here."""
The decision was made before the first step on the stair is made. The jumper may not be aware directly but there are there for a reason.
"You can make it harder, possibly to prevent death by ""misadventure"", but that is all you can really do."
Is the sculpture really that bad ?
"3 suicides in less than a year. Tragic and I hope anyone reading this can know that you are worth it, yes a total stranger believes it, you are worth seeking help. It doesn’t matter how many times you’ve fucked up, please reach out to anyone."
"It was unclear when the 150-foot structure would reopen to the public. A spokesman for the Related Companies, the developer of Hudson Yards, said the firm was consulting with psychiatrists and other suicide-prevention experts about steps it could take to limit the potential for future suicides."
"Install a net, may be?"
"This bigass stair case to nowhere cost like $100,000,000.00 to build.  No roof, doors, windows or anything.  That's just crazy."
Big ass illegal tax breaks from the corrupt elected officials .

They should reinstall it over a deep pool.
"Hudson's Yards is a perfect encapsulation of the inequality that, as a key feature of US society, drives so many of its people to desperation."
We have a bridge in Seattle people love to jump off of.  It's right above adobe's parking lot.  They installed some fences to keep folks from jumping about 6 years ago. Not sure how effective they have been as a deterrent.
"Have been to the vessel a few times and, although I am not suicidal, my first thought when I first visited was, ""wow it is way too easy to jump off of this thing."" Railings are entirely too low. They should do what the architects did at the Edge...high glass 'walls'."
This entire thing was predictable. There are almost no barricades preventing anybody from jumping or any other means of preventing people from jumping. We were working next door to the 'vessel' when it was being built and we called it the suicide stair.
Hopefully they'll add some serious safety upgrades before they consider opening this thing up again.
"You can “rail off” the entire planet, as desperation will always find a way. It’s not about physical prevention, but psychological assistance."
Fucking thank you!
"We are a sum total of our whole.  If not brothers and sisters, what the hell are we worth individually?"
"Not a damn thing. After turning a blind eye for too many years I'm pretty ashamed. Took my own shattering of mind to see it. One humanity, a collective of organisms creating a super organism."
"True that. Grain of sand in the desert of man, and all. The protective dune doesn’t build itself."
"They could build a wall around it, just to be sure no one gets hurt. With guards, in case someone tries to climb the wall. And barbed wire on top."
This is an example of insurance companies threatening to no longer cover their liability.
Could they have visitors sign a consent waiver?
We are living in lawyer heaven.
Nanny state?  Its the owners of it that shut it down.  The whole point of the Vessel is marketing and atmosphere for the surrounding developments at Hudson Yards to create value.  Being seen as a suicide destination is going to destroy that value they are trying to build.  The reasons for shut down are just as likely to be protecting their investment as they are for protecting people.
