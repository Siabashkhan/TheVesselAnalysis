"Very cool! What is this, where in the city is it, and does the Galactic Senate meet here often?"
I am the Senate.
Not yet.
It's called The Vessel. It's a new structure in NYC's Hudson Yards district.
"It's where we house our Gundams, Battlemechs, and, one day soon, our Jaegar."
Thanks!
"Let's be honest. As others have said on this subreddit about The Vessel: For some people, this is going to the last thing they see before they jump."
That's dark.
They're installing ziplines.
Tony hawk pro skater secret level.
Wait is that like a rack and pinion going up the side of the elevator part to the right?
Yeah thats the fdny elevator. For emergency use only.
Can't imagine the artist was happy about that.

I don't understand what is the purpose of this structure? Is it an office building or just some type of monument?
it's a monument to our lord cthulu
How would this be an office building when it's completely outdoors?
This is a special structure for playing a weird new sport. Its called Poop Ball
this is the most exciting modern architecture since modern times
Its a kick in the crotch to walk all the way up. I spent all day walking up and down every stair case.
When will the honey be installed?
I can't imagine the size of that queen bee.
While our metro system falls to the stone age behind many other countries. 1st world red tape problems
"The Vessel is it's name? I'm just going to stick with what I like to call it, The Hive."
Looks really nice actually
when does it open?
Will it be already open the last week of March? I'll be visiting on those days and I'm wondering which part of the whole complex will be accessible.
Good luck.  I doubt it though.
ive been getting instagram adds saying its going to be open march 15th. i trust those like the MTA tho
Looks like a futuristic slum
"The way the described Hudson Yards at orientation. ""Hudson Yards is a city within the city."""
"There's going to be a fire department and police department there. I imagine people that have kids there, those kids will never need to leave the site. They can get educated, find a job, and eventually retire there."
Its a weird dystopia
"I mean, doesn't this describe a lot of neighborhoods in the city?"
Definitely sounds like the slums of the future ._.
I take it that itâ€™s not handicap accessible...
there is an elevator!
Pretty sure its not ADA compliant
I think you have to pay and reserve a time slot to walk the stairs .
"Well for now, I got to do it for free. And I'm sure when the whole place opens I won't want to go there."
So we can literally go now? Because I wanna go before mass dumb tourist and idiots start going there
Negative.  You have to work on site.  And if you're a construction worker you have to go through the longest moat boring-est orientation ever.
I hear is opening in March right ?
They say march 15th. But the amount of construction left to do says no...
Well only time will tell then
