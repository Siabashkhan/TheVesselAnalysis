This has to be traumatizing as hell for anyone and everyone that had to witness it.
Probably looking for attention in death that was missing while alive. Or at least that is what I guess passes through their minds.

"I'm fucked up, but even I can't imagine how someone the likes of you gets joy out of joking about the death of a child. Your actions are truly vile."
"You are the worst kind of person, trying to use someone else's depression to spread religion"
