Is there going to be a cost of admission or  is it open to the public?
Open to the public. It's a public space
*public- private space. Fewer and fewer public spots are around.
"Usually these types of arrangements are negotiated by the city with a developer to create a public space in exchange for developing a project, don't know about this specific case, though."
"Yes, though they remain private property of the owners and they reserve the right to restrict access/kick people out if they choose to.  Zucotti Park was one such space, which is why the NYPD was eventually able to dismantle the Occupy Wall Street encampments."
Probably a good thing. It doesn't end up weighing down the city budget and it's less subject to the egotistical whims of changing mayors and governors.
"Yeah, and it stops being open to the public soon enough."
Can you skateboard on it??! Or get some parkour dudes on it.
I think it's mostly steps.
UNSUBSCRIBED
So yes

How nobody considered larger panels of glass on the top is beyond me
Hate to say it but one of the first thoughts was someone is going to jump off the top of it. Next was the.lawsuits because it's not wheelchair accessible. World we live in.
"It is accessible, there's an elevator visible in the back."
It is fully wheelchair accessible.
"They probably will have rules against that and some physical barriers to make it difficult, but doubtless some will try."
You can definitely try!
"Sort of. It’s owned by Related Companies, the HY developer, but is open to the public."
I went to a reception for the developer and I believe that you do need to get tickets for specific timed entry
Just imagine how crowded this will get the way the high line is now. But from what I've read u have to reserve  a time slot to go see it at least till the hype calms down

According to a few articles it’s “copper-colored” steel so I think that means it won’t turn green - it’s just a coloration not real copper?
This is correct. It's electro coated steel panels.

electro coated steel
Coated with copper then? Cause that will turn green.
"I'm sorry, to be more precise the facade panels were electrophoreticly painted to their copper color. They are not actually coated in copper."
well that’s a bummer.

Have you seen Contact?
"It's a place for people to commit suicide from. Kinda like the NYU library, and pretty much every other place in the city with tall, open structures."
I never understood the logic of that - were they laboring under the delusion that enclosing it with plexiglass was going to reduce overall number of suicides?
"It does reduce the overall number of suicides. The act of suicide is very often impulsive, for people with suicidal ideations."
The act of suicide is very often impulsive That is pure speculation; no way to poll the dead for 'was that on impulse or a considered move'?
Most suicide attempts fail so it’s easy to poll people who thought they were killing themselves
It may be easy to poll them but you are making inferences about all suicides by polling a subset - attempted-suicides. Not the same thing.
You should inform the professional academics and who have spent their entire careers studying suicide applying those learnings to saving the lives of suicidal people about this incredibly obvious example of survivorship bias. They probably haven’t thought about it.
"You know of survivorship bias, but you make sweeping statements about a variable that is extremely prone to that bias."
"These are not my statements, it’s the consensus position of academics who are undoubtedly well aware of and account for survivorship bias"
It does reduce the overall number of suicides.
"Are you sure it doesn't just change how people commit suicide vs the overall number?  Without fixing the underlying mental health issues, I don't see how it can."
for people with suicidal ideations.
That kinda means it's not impulsive right?  These people have been thinking of commit the act for weeks or months in most cases.
"To your second question, no, suicidal ideations can linger for years but the actual decision to commit suicide is often impulsive and fleeting."
"To your first question, see above"
actual decision to commit suicide is often impulsive and fleeting.
"My decision of what to order for lunch today was impulsive and fleeting, but I was always going to get lunch."
"Without improved mental health care in this country, all the suicide netting in the world won't put a dent in suicides.  I very much doubt your claim things like this reduce suicides overall.  It may just reduce very public suicides and change the method."
That was what the parent to my comment suggested
"> My decision of what to order for lunch today was impulsive and fleeting, but I was always going to get lunch."
"There have been plenty of cases of people who have done things like buying a pack of cigarettes, and then committed suicide 5 min later without having ever smoked one. That means pretty much any of us could be 5 min away from committing suicide and not even know it."
That doesn’t prove anything.  They may have second thoughts and done anything to delay their action.
""
"To be cold and detached about it, it's a library where students are trying to get work done. It makes sense to care about not having them disrupted by a suicide even if you can't ensure that the people aren't killing themselves somewhere else."
"As someone else said, suicide is usually done impulsively."
"If you reduce the availability of easy suicide methods, people actually kill themselves less. It’s one reason that suicides by gun are often mentioned in discussions of gun control. Widespread gun ownership actually increases suicide rates because it makes it so much easier for people to do impulsively."
""
Yeah I'm not convinced that NYU did it to stop disruptions to students so much as to their inability to say no to the people who wanted a 'simple solution' to prevent suicides.
"Yeah, sadly, this will happen. I'm sure they will have things to help prevent it. But that's inevitable"

It's privately funded by Stephen Ross (Related Companies).
The government is not paying for this.

Yeah! Stupid art wasting our taxes not doing anything. They should just tear this down and build something utilitarian. Dismantle the Statue of Liberty while they’re at it. Pave over Central Park too; I mean what good is that place doing? Taking up all that space and using up our taxes in maintenance.
looks like a pinecone
""
Make us whole again
or a transformers chastity belt
There’s graffiti on a lamp post right across the street from it that reads: “Pine Cone Meets Death Star”
a sleek futuristic pinecone. I love it
Wut is it actually tho
Stairs
but why
"I don't know. Some would say humans just find an appeal in building up, others would say it's a proxy for a metaphorical penis size competition"
I believe it’s supposed to be a honeycomb.
This would be some sick ass armor to put on Lady Liberty when she levels up.
"Well, if that's copper how it seems, unless it has been coated for preventing oxidizing, it will turn greenish. Actually I'm quite confident that with all the new materials and composite, they had chosen for a not oxidizing alloy."
"Yep, it’s actually steel that’s just been treated to look the color of copper. So it won’t ever turn green."
"Aw, bummer"
"Probably unpopular opinion - I think that copper after it has oxidized and turned into that putrid green color is ugly as all get out. It's something you get used to, but it's a pale shadow of what it once was."
"I find the green attractive but green is one of my favorite colors in any hue. However, I would've loved to have seen the Statue of Liberty when she was the color of a brand new penny."
I love a brand new penny
Same. It took about 20 years for the change to happen but she was completely green by 1920.
"When I was little (late nineties), I asked my parents if they remembered when the Statue of Liberty was less green. They were offended."
Oh no....you are a bold one. 😂😂😂😂
You probably could not have looked directly at it on a sunny day.
Could you imagine a clear summer's day in 1886? You could probably see her for miles.
"Go check out the American Copper Buildings, at 626 First Avenue! Real copper facade installed in 2015, which will turn green in the next few decades."
"There was a plan a few years ago to polish the statue, but then everyone realize that they might get half way though and stop and the project would never be done."
"Fun fact: a lot of older buildings in NYC (the Woolworth for example) replaced their copper roofs with different material decades ago, but they paint the roof that shade of green because it’s what people expect it to look like."
So that's what that iconic green roof color is! I thought it was some sort of weatherproofing.
Turns out it's the same erosian the statue of liberty had (and what later renevotions honored).
"That green color is so iconic NY though. Woolsworth Building, Statue of Liberty, Manhattan Bridge, 40 Wall St. You see it echoed everywhere even when the material isn’t copper, like on window frames and doors. I think it’s quite nice."
"Manhattan Bridge? Pretty sure that's painted blue, my man."
Oh maybe it is blue. It always looks greenish to me.
When I was typing that I was recalling this “color influence diagram” that Shop Architects presented for their 247 Cherry St Tower (the Two Bridges Project) which they are going to clad in a green hue terra-cotta. They listed the bridge as one of their influences.
"Unfortunately, nature is full of colors and hues you cannot control....even the inorganic stuff...."
Agreed.  The Statue of Liberty would be so much more amazing looking if it were a gleaming shade of copper.  Rusty green is just meh.  My parents have a rusty-looking green copper roof that I feel the same way about.  So many better alternatives.
""
"For some odd reason it works on statues though, but only them."
"“Well, actually”  and “Probaly unpopular opinion”."
"Yeah, they definitely did something to keep it copper like that.  It's been under construction for a long time and it would have started getting green months ago.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's not even real copper, but some kind of man made material."
Well I think this is really cool. The rest of hudson yards turned out pretty generic but at least this is interesting.
"It looks cool and it’s public space, I’m not mad at it."
"It is, but it's pretty out of the way. This area does see a lot of tourists but only really as an entry point from Penn, or a transition to grand central. There's kind of no other reason to come to Hudson yards otherwise."
"Don't forget that the High Line extends up right by it too, which definitely adds some foot traffic."
Good call. I'm always a little confused about this area though. They keep building new apartments and not filling them. I can't help but imagine that they're oversaturating the market.
It's not oversaturated until the prices start coming down.
"Also, don’t underestimate the increased pedestrian activity Hudson yards is going to see when One Hudson Yards (office space, mall, department stores, restaurants) is finished this spring."
"This giant pineapple is just an attraction to bring in foot traffic. The building directly behind it in the picture is going to be a mall... but not a useful mall that has regularly consumed commodities, it's a rich people mall with jewelry shops and probably a Gucci store, similar to the kind you see inside the Occulas or the one in the Time Warner building at Columbus Circle."
It’s not copper so it will not oxidize. It’s high polished stainless steel
Serious question: How the hell did that cost $200 million to build?
That number must be reasonable enough because I can’t even tell whether you’re implying that it’s cheap or expensive.
You could build a 150 unit condo tower for that price.
In Manhattan? Kinda doubt that.
""
"$302/SF means you could built roughly 600,000 SF of residential tower for $200MM."
The land is another thing.
The land is another thing.
Really? Where exactly will you be building then?
""
New York City's $98.30 per hour average construction wage was second
"Alright, that sounds a bit more reasonable as to what I would expect."
"Prevailing wage, man. It's gonna be one of the big political fights in Albany this year come May or June."
I work in CRE. $302 is highly aggressive. I don't know anyone who would actually budget a figure that low.
"Also, you can't just ignore land. In an urban environment like NYC it can be 1/3rd of the cost."
Cost of labor
"Also, it's a major pain in the ass doing anything in manhattan.  Parking, traffic delaying your delivery, unions."
Everything takes a lot longer than it would elsewhere because every little thing gets complicated by some bullshit.
There's just not enough room to organize a construction site to make it efficient.
"Well it's taking up a lot of prime NYC real estate space, so there's that"
I wanna know what will happen once Manhattan cap out and is not more free space for new buildings.
"There's always more space - for example, by building over train yards..."
Demolish small buildings and build taller ones.
"Queens and BK would get gentrified even more, and maybe some parks in Manhattan would be replaced by buildings."
Nah man that’s fucking up the environment I doubt they will do that
"If they got desperate enough I could see it happening, the real estate money is very influential in our local politics."
Parks in Manhattan make the real estate around it more valuable. It's no surprise that Billionaire's Row is right by Central Park.
Exactly without parks then what’s the point
It was well into $300m by the time I finished my portion of work mid December.
"But to answer your question a large chunk of money was for Labor. From what I gathered it sounded like someone didn't account for lose of days due to inclimate weather when a time table was estimated. Who ever is in charge of financial decisions decided to just throw money at the problem and a lot of us worked close to 70 hours a week (which was awesome for my bank account, but terrible for my social life)."
"In hindsight, just about any problem that came up was handled by throwing either money or manpower at it. Normally this would be great on any other job, but the general contracting company, Tishman, treats the work force rather poorly. Example, despite Hudson Yards being the largest active construction site in North America (their claim of employing 40000) the yard around the vessel only had 5 port-a-johns, and no running water, for several hundred workers which were rarely serviced despite the johns next to the managers trailers being cleaned every day. It wasn't until a board meeting was interrupted by union representatives with the threat of calling dep of health for health code violations that anything was done about it."
It’s huge and complicated to fabricate and construct.
I walked past it on the highline as it was getting built and from a distance to my stupid eyes they looked like many many individually cast single pieces of metal. That they then LEGO’d and bolted together. It looked like so much one off work for a massive metal foundry.
Not sure what else you’d expect?  To smelt it in Manhattan?
No that’s exactly what I expected but I’m saying that price tag is not surprising given the amount of massive one-off metal components
There’s a steel furnace party in Philly in April. Do attend.

"This is to inform you that all the food ate since first grade is alive in your body, especially the dead animal remains or meat since it was cooked alive and is alive in your body. Anywhere it goes now, you must go with it. That’s 365 days a year from first grade to now."
"Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner."

"Also, newborn baby received your first grade body, or a meal just like the 365 days a year."

Do you have a source for the number?
I'm guessing the cost includes the park around the structure as well.

That's as far as it goes.

"If the WTC's Oculus is any indication, give it a year."
It’s just a bunch of stairs. Is it ADA compliant?
It has an elevator that will take visitors to one platform. Not really the same experience though to just go up and down.
Not everything has to be made for the lowest common denominator.
"No, but that's a rude way to refer to people with disabilities, and there could have been creative ways to allow for different viewpoints and experiencing different landings. It's very much just ""ticking the box"" of being ADA compliant without actually allowing a broader range of people to have a meaningful experience. But if you ask me taking the stairs up isn't going to be a very interesting experience either, so I don't know if people who need the elevator will be missing out on much....."
"You started with no, but then argued yes.  My stance is that it’s ok if some artistic creation like this isn’t suitable for 100% of people to use 100% of. It’s still pleasant to look at from the street or from the top."
Vessel (structure)
"Vessel (alternately called Hudson Yards Staircase) is a public structure and landmark that is under construction as part of the Hudson Yards Redevelopment Project in Manhattan, New York City. The concept for Vessel was revealed in 2016. Construction started in April 2017 and the structure topped out in December 2017."
"The elaborate honeycomb-like structure rises 16 stories and consists of 154 flights of stairs, 2,500 steps, and 80 landings that visitors would be able to climb."
""

There are no ramps on the actual structure. Every horizontal landing is connected diagonally by stairs.
Take a look at the photo. There are curved elevators.
Why did we put a Cylon resurrection ship right on Erth?
It won't oxidize because it's not copper.
apparently it's not real copper so it won't turn green.
How long until the workout bros take over?
Its treated copper. It'll never turn green. I work there and know the guys that installed it.
"Wow your title implies that the Statue of Liberty wasn’t always green , it honesty  🤯🤯🤯 me."
I didn’t realized it
It was green by the time it got installed though.  So you could argue that it has always been green.  If you don't want friends.
when does it open?
March 15th.
"Copper goes green, steel beams go rust"
The people in the apartment behind it are going to have calves the size of watermelons
Is this one of those art pieces where fat people are not going to utilize and have someone sue on their behalf?
"Regardless, it's pretty dumb looking. I saw it being built 3 years ago and was expecting something interesting. This doesn't deliver. A giant stair master machine for office workers to gaze at while they're stuck in their cubicles."
"If it's anodized polished aluminum, never."
All I can think of is that those waist high rails are not going to stop anyone from jumping 😨
"They're not waist height - they're probably about 4' high based on renderings, so chest height for adults, and chin/head height for children."
I’m kinda worried about people dropping stuff. A phone from that height could really hurt.
That’s still not high enough to stop jumpers
A lot of places in the city don't have barriers high enough to stop jumpers.  Hasn't been an epidemic yet.
"Okay, maybe, so? Jumpers are gonna jump off of something."
I don't know what other safety features they have in place - just saying the glass is a lot taller than it appears.
“I wonder how long it will take for it to turn green....” this is such a reddit thing to say.
"Look, teams architects/ engineers and consultants designed and built this thing. It’s a major feature of the city, you fucking think they are going to use an old ass material like bronze or copper to clad this?"
"The 'new' DeYoung Museum in San Francisco never did turn green, not even after a decade. By comparison, the crowns of the WFC towers turned green pretty damned fast."
"Well shit, I thought this was the base and structure for a building"
A bunch of expensive stairs with no real purpose and little aesthetic value... what a perfect analogy for modern society.
Wait in line to walk up some stairs...wow NY is so great....uhh hope this thing falls in the river.
What. the. fuck is the purpose of this hulking lump of trash that cost 200 million dollars?
Aesthetics and culture. Next you'll be asking why the WTC's Oculus cost so much as a glorified roof.
"Yeah, it doesn't make sense from an economic perspective."
And not everything can be made sense of from (merely) an economic perspective. I'm not the greatest fan of the Vessel but it's a bit daft to think economics must determine everything.
No art does.
what?
No art makes sense from an economic perspective.
"Why waste time and money on it, then?"
"For the same reason that we waste time and money on life, I suppose. It would be most economically viable to commit suicide, but where's the fun in that?"

Honestly this whole time I just thought they were constructing a building reeeeally slowly.

Spoilers: 20-30 years.  Assuming that is pure copper and isn't coated in some way.
"A week, maybe two."
I did a promo photo shoot on that over the summer. It's pretty amazing
Has it been clear-coated? It may take decades...Or the city can create 'good paying jobs' for people to keep it polished!   It would take an awful lot of Twinkle. ;-)
It took 30 years for the statue of liberty
Isn't this connected directly with the equinox hotel that's opening?
So sick
"Question: why won’t they restore the Statue of Liberty to its original shiny form? Is something preventing them from doing so, or what?"
"It took 30 years for the Statue to turn green, so expect the same for this one if it was made out of copper. However, it's stainless steel made to look like copper so it'll be like that forever"
6 stories of tourists walking slowly and a Spider-Man trying to charge them for photos on every tier.
"NYC's newest, shiny and posh suicide designation."
"Despite your pessimism you shouldn't be getting down voted. The top floor is certainly a death trap. The railings are only about 4ft over the walkway. I, being over 6tf, was very uncomfortable being at the top. It can also get Very windy at that height being that there is currently nothing to block the wind coming off the river. The most notable trouble areas are where the top most stairs meets the top most platforms and the railing steeply dips down. Someone can easily go over the edge, intentionally or not. We started taking bets on how long it will take after opening for someone to go off. I'm very confident the top, if not the whole structure, will be closed off within the first month."
"Thank you. Finally, someone who has a shared perspective. No doubt the top promenade will be enclosed just as our other glorious, tall attractions. Just a matter of time."
"edit: I DO hope all bets are off, and no one ever gets hurt. I truly do."
Someone's going to get sued.
<-- looking at watch
Gotta wait for the first death for them to realize it was a dumb fuck idea to build this and THEN they scramble to make it “safe”.
"Hey, if you're gonna go, why not go out in style?"
I don't know what to think of this thing. It's so far from the water with a view looking to a random place in jersey surrounded by generic glass towers. (The shed is cool though.) Plus there's an ugly highway between it and the water. Maybe it world have been better to leave it as a nice plaza to hang out on next to food vendors.
I’m banned from going there unfortunately
What is the point of this? Couldn't they have put in a stair machine and used the rest for housing nobody lives in? I guess it's the same either way.
What is the point of this?
It's beautiful and rad.
"You could make the same argument against the Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty, or any other public space."
I might be wrong but I doubt this will be here as long as they have existed. I give it 50 years till it is torn down.
"Yeah, this one doesn't hold much historical or symbolic value. It symbolizes a developer having lots of money."
Okay? That's how the vast majority of great architecture is commissioned
Also it’s not in as good a location as the statue or the tower.
yet
That's how history works. It was just born; give it time to make memories.
"Yeah, if it lasts long enough it could become a piece of history but I still think it lacks in the symbolic appeal that monuments like the Statue of Liberty and the Effiel tower have (the Effiel tower was made for the world's fair 100 years after the revolution). Regardless I'm excited to see it when it opens!"
""
It would bloody last longer than it will if it actually gave a good view of anything but it's completely surrounded by Hudson Yards. Maybe they can see NJ and the river but it's not in a optimal position.
""
Dumbest waste of money ever.
Just be glad you didn't pay a dime then.
Not a single tax dollar went to building this thing?
The rate of oxidation is largely dependent on airborne impurities coupled with the overall composition of material found in the structure.
"There are several theories about pollution, namely foreign contaminants introduced directly on to the surface of buildings such as this one."
"Barry Ignacious Reginald the thirD PrOpOsed Pollution actually has no effect. Hopped up on moldy bread he found in a park he decided to go on a ""science bender,"" spreading feces on the face of multiple structures, predominantly overpasses."
"While his work did not do much to propel the science community forward in regard to the overarching hypothesis, his work can be found all over the city."
Aesthetics and culture.
Are they seriously not going to put up suicide netting?
"Protecting people from themselves is one Pandora's box I don't want to open. If we believe that people are autonomous individuals, then we ought to respect that."
"Regardless of your opinion, the first person that suicides off of it will cause nets or other additional safety features to be put in place."
"Interesting prediction, seeing as how the two falling deaths under the WTC's Oculus resulted in no new safety measures or installations."
"Well, things take time, look at the GWB."
