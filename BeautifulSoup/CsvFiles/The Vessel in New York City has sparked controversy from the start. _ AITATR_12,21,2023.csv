"Designed by British architect Thomas Heatherwick, this 16-story, 150-foot-tall piece of public art resides within the Hudson Yards area of Manhattan."
"This architectural marvel consists of 154 interconnected flights of stairs, boasting a staggering 2,500 steps and 80 landings arranged in a spiral pattern. Its primary aim was to serve as a gathering spot for social interaction, featuring a captivating viewing platform atop the structure."
"Despite its intended allure, the Vessel has encountered substantial criticism. The project's estimated cost of $200 million drew ire from some quarters, questioning the justification for such a hefty investment. Moreover, detractors voiced concerns over the design's complexity, deeming it confusing or even perilous."
"Upon its grand opening to the public in March 2019, the Vessel swiftly transformed into a sought-after tourist hotspot, drawing millions of visitors annually."
"However, amidst its popularity, tragedy struck in 2021 when a woman tragically fell to her death from the Vessel. Prompted by safety concerns, the structure underwent rigorous inspections, resulting in its temporary closure."
