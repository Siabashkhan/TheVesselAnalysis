An idiotic waste of concrete..
“Stop liking what I don’t like!”
“Stop having an opinion different from mine!”
Exactly. Calling it “idiotic” because you don’t happen to like it is ridiculous.
As if there aren’t countless suicide spots in New York already.
"It’s tragic that an Escher-esque work like this is being ruined by those unable to obtain mental health assistance. But that’s a failing of American society, not the architecture itself."
Maybe if they spent all the materials and money to build affordable housing ...
This is a publicly-accessible tower built with private money on private land in a free-market society.
The fact American governments put a pithy amount into affordable housing initiatives is an entirely separate issue.
Conflating the two is whataboutism and accordingly nonsense.
Are you suggesting that private entités can't direct their funds to useful affordable housing ?
That if they are willing to suffer a loss it cannot be for the good of the poor (who are increasingly employed) but that it must be a pointless gesture ?
That has nothing to do with this project.
I think they had an elevator to take people directly to the top
