Just a trick to get people to exercise
There's an elevator.
"Aw, how lame haha"
"Yeah, I believe it is a requirement because of ADA laws."
Lol in terms of ADA this is quite possibly the most unfriendly ADA structure of all time.
You're not supposed to use elevators in emergencies.
This isn’t remotely true
"Still an emergency, strictly prohibited"
Perhaps for medical emergencies?
I would of just made a spiral ramp around the outside!
Its actually a pretty cool elevator. its a glass capsule that follows that black track on the left in the photo.
Yea fuck those lame disabled people 🙄
Naw just u
Herrr deeeeeerrrrrr derrrrrrrr
indeed = it's lame that people w disabilities need an elevator.
The elevator is reserved for disability use only
"Yup! Was about to say that, I was there two weeks ago and me being lazy wanted to take the elevator but they said it is for disability only. The Vessel is quite a workout lol"
So that's what this thing looks like up close!
Dad? What's that building?
... Stairs
""
It is
90% of this development is Japanese owned (edit - by Japanese investment bank Mitsui Fudosan)
It is as much a way to convert Yen to Dollar as anything else
"Oh, I guess that’s why we keep seeing ads for Hudson Yards here in Tokyo"
"That is partially incorrect. Hudson yards has 16 structures, two of which they have a 90+ % stake. Specifically, hey have that stake in Hudson yards 50 and 55."
"I, too, saw an MC Escher poster while in college."
Godel Escher Bach is like this fully
I read that this place is using lawyers to try to take the copyrights of any pictures taken in the place.
"Not copyrights, a license to use the pictures taken there for whatever they want.  There is a legal difference.  By getting a ticket, you grant a non-revocable license for them to use any picture that you upload."
http://gothamist.com/2019/03/18/psa_the_vessel_claims_it_owns_all_your_photos.php
it's creepy.
What right would it infringe on
You’re giving consent by buying a ticket though.  Contract trumps copyright.
"How is it fraudulent it’s literally on the face of the ticket.  It’s no different from signing up for an account on Reddit.  By signing up you agree to the terms and services, which includes giving reddit an nonexclusive perpetual license to use any photos you post.  Do you think that’s fraudulent?"
They probably have the terms online way you purchase a ticket
Huh? If you’re on the vessel it means you had a ticket....
Germany?
That doesn't make sense. The whole point of this thing is to be shared as much as possible and draw attention to their hyper-expensive bullshit for hyper-rich fuckwads
But then the tourists wouldn't get the authentic American experience of being involved in a frivolous lawsuit. What kind of stories do you expect them to bring back to their home countries? Tales of navigating the subway and eating a one dollar hot dog?
One dollar hot dog. Lol
"Oh sorry, I forgot my /s tag. Apologies."
"Every time I've said the Hudson Yards development was stupid bullshit for billionaires I got downvoted to hell on here, but it's true. Just an exorbitantly expensive development for very wealthy people to extend their dominion over the city a little bit more, such a dumb project."
The last thing New York needs is more luxury skyscrapers filled with empty condos that foreign aristocrats use to smuggle their money out of their actual homes.
"Thankfully the working people of New York are resilient, otherwise the city would be a soulless monstrosity, a gilded shell of a city without any of the things that made it great."
"My condolences, Vancouver is an awesome city but ridiculously expensive. I believe a lot of early Property Brothers (HGTV show) were filmed there and they would frequently look at some piece of shit house that was like $1million CAD. Just insane housing prices considering it's not as densely packed or land-limited as NYC or SF; where prices are also ridiculous but more understandable."
"Yeah, the most horrifying, sickening thing is seeing people trying to defend the ultra-wealthy and the culture that outright encourages the already-ludicrous income equality we're experiencing *right now*. I don't get it."
"Enjoy your upvotes this day, brother!"
Educate me. Isn’t this just stairs? Like a public space? I’m against shitty condos designed to launder foreign money. But I don’t understand how this is that.
"The criticism is exactly that it's just stairs. It serves no purpose. It has no function or reason for being. It was just made for millionaires to flaunt their wealth. While technically publicly accessible, when you buy a ticket you waive all copywrites to any photos you take. The elevator, which is necessary for access by disabled people, is clearly tacked on as an afterthought. The surrounding development, built as part of the same complex, only serves the elite. It's a monument for the rich and regular people have been blessed to be given access to this small sliver of it. The whole Hudson Yards complex is fucking bullshit, and the Vessel is the epitome of it."
""
"Good to know.  And coming from a place where excessive wealth is killing basically everyone else, I get it."
I can’t help but respect it from a design/aesthetics POV though.
"The architect, Thomas Heatherwick, has done some pretty interesting stuff and the Vessel is definitely eye-catching, the context is what makes people hate it so much."
"So, I read the article you linked and it seems totally ungrounded. It criticizes the business of real estate for no reason. The author doesn't like how it looks, but that's subjective, and most people seem to like it."
The Vessel looks cool and attracts visitors to the neighbourhood. What's your beef?
"Wait, the way I talked about Hudson Yards, why would you think it was just these stairs?"
"Hudson Yards is a large private development project, it's a luxury mall, some offices, and a lot of residential space. The stairs are just a small part of it, but emblematic about how insipid, vapid, and gaudy/decadent the rest of the development is going to be."
It's strictly a space for people with money and a cultural marker of the decay of an accessible New York.
a lot of residential space
"This is an important part though! At least it's taking some of the demand off the market. Ideally we'd have that pied-a-terre tax on out-of-city gazillionaires buying apartments, but even without it, we should be happy there's at least SOME residential build amidst the glass office towers and the probably doomed mall."
"Yeah, that residential space isn't going to be accessible for 99.999% of New Yorkers. That's why people hate that project. Truly couldn't give a shit they're building space for the children of wealthy people from the midwest or wherever they hail from these days, it does nothing to stem the problem of adequate housing."
"If they were building good, nice, brand new affordable units for families and working people I'd be singing a different turn, but this a playground for rich people they built out of thin air specifically for the moneyed elites."
"It's like celebrating a new stadium being built as good for the community but all the tickets to every single event are like $10,000, only a select few are going to be able to attend anything."
"Lolz it literally does tho. Don't get me wrong - I desperately want there to be new housing built for non-super-rich people (and there is some movement on that front, as much as it may seem otherwise), but if the rich moving to NYC aren't buying places in Hudson Yards, they're buying places in real neighborhoods, encouraging local landlords start doing what they do best: jacking up rent and pushing out longtime residents. We need luxury housing just like we need Times Square - a sinkhole to prevent people from spilling out and overwhelming the rest of the city even more than they already do."
""
"Edit: Also stadium construction is far more useless than any housing, and you know it!"
That's... not how this works.
"No my guy, you're imagining people who'd post up in a luxury skyscraper on the west side of Manhattan would also be the same people to move into like East New York or something?"
The initial gentrifying forces are not being pushed out of Manhattan and into deep south west Brooklyn by a lack of luxury real estate...
"These are very different types of people you're talking about, this isn't a math equation like ""More luxury apartments means less people moving into working neighborhoods."" No, affordable housing in places already lost to the moneyed elites means less people moving into working class neighborhoods."
"The people able to afford these Hudson Yard apartments would never in a million years be the first ones to move into a neighborhood that hadn't been gentrified for years already. People who can't afford to live elsewhere in New York are the first to move into the neighborhood, having been priced out of the areas already ruined by developments like Hudson Yards."
"Fine. More luxury apartments means fewer people moving into the UWS/UES/the Village, which means fewer upper middle class people moving to Harlem, Bushwick, and Astoria, which means fewer middle income people moving to Bed-Stuy, Crown Heights, and Jackson Heights. East New York is at the stage where blight is still far more of an issue than rampant gentrification, as is much of the Bronx. It's hard for Williamsburg brocialists (not saying you're one, just that I've seen a lot of this in general) to wrap their heads around that, since they don't go to parts of the city that they can't get to in over half an hour."
""
"Why is it a binary choice? Why not build more luxury housing AND more affordable housing in rich neighborhoods? I want glass towers in Hudson Yards, *and* more affordable housing in Tribeca!"
It’s part of a zillion dollar complex called Hudson Yards that’s just feeding into the 2001~ soulless takeover of NYC by foreign buyers and chain stores catering to immature Chinese tourists
"I agree, but something people often overlook is what Hudson Yards replaced. It was a rail yard with no land for development. The Hudson Yards project did not displace people or ruin neighborhoods. I think there should have been a more practical development there so it can be a real, working-class neighborhood. I hope that happens with Sunnyside Yards, but Im not hopeful"
There have been a lot of architecture critics calling bullshit on Hudson Yards since it opened. You're not alone!
I hear its gonna be part of a gigantic fucking luxury mall. Like NYC doesn't already have a shitload of luxe stores? Went down to the Oculus at the World Trade Center and it was another god damned high end mall.
Consumerism is a blight.
That area of the city was a desolate shit hole before this development started.
"Even if most of it is rich assholes, some progress is better than nothing and that’s always the way the city has been."
They aren’t taking copyrights.  You agree to grant them a license to any pictures that you take there.  They want free pictures for advertising purposes.
"You can downvote me for correcting you, but there is a difference between copyright and a license."
It’s an onerous license and I personally disagree with the extent of it.
"it doesn't make sense because its wrong. they can't take your copyright. what they do though, is making you automatically allow them to reuse your photo for whatever purpose they want, most likely just their own advertisements. also i think you aren't allowed to use your photo for COMMERCIAL purposes (whatever that means, open to interpretation as opposed to artistic purposes i guess)."
"pretty sure this is kind of standard, same reason you can't take a picture of a coca cola can and then sell that picture as stock footage (unless for editorial purposes, but not commercial)"
use your photo for COMMERCIAL purposes
i.e. sell as postcards
"also i think you aren't allowed to use your photo for COMMERCIAL purposes (whatever that means, open to interpretation as opposed to artistic purposes i guess)."
"This could open up an interesting legal quandary for Instagram ""influencers"" with large follower counts who make their money being sponsored and inserting paid content into their posting. For these people (who are ""famous"" as Instagrammers but not otherwise), their job is posting, and their timeline is basically a vehicle for advertising content, making their posts a ""commercial"" use. I'm interested to see if this will ever be explored in court, here or otherwise — especially 'cause this thing is an Instagram trap of the highest caliber."
"I imagine this who they're targeting, influencers who want to film their videos here without a permit."
I always wondered who they “influence” ?
I'm pretty sure after so much backlash they pulled back on that.  Not sure of the specifics but I know they bent to public uproar.
A real “public uproar” or a “twitter backlash” or a “social media storm” ?
Idk how you’d wanna define it. But certainly twitter and social media but it was also a story being covered on the major nightly news stations and websites.
"I mean if you're just taking a selfie with your family I'm sure they don't care. If you're trying to sell the image to use commercially, that's when they'll get you."
"yeah, but who knows how far they will be willing to take things with big data. They get their claws into your life with the contract IMO."
I am not super involved with legal stuff and am not really in the mood to further involve myself with it.
The laws cost a lot of money to deal with and can act as a wedge against those who cannot afford to address them. The laws can also force you to adopt them and force a loaded culture of imperialism unto the perceiver.
"well, here is a link to the article that I read on the subject"
https://petapixel.com/2019/03/18/nycs-new-vessel-landmark-has-a-big-photo-copyright-grab/
"well, it doesn't seem ethical and many would agree."
"well, I don't think it's cool to have gangs running things twisting the laws around in funny ways. Seems to be a slippery slope. But here we are flushing away the world's wealth of biodiversity. They can take their magical legal space and shove it up some dark and horrible place. Who goes and makes a place and then says, ""oh yeah, but we own any photograph taken here."" Seems pretty bizarre  like something that 5 year olds come up with."
to each their own I suppose.
better hire a lawyer before getting wrapped up in whatever they are offering... not my bread and butter that's for sure.
Interesting. Following the thread to see if anyone knows more.
here is the article that I got my info from
https://petapixel.com/2019/03/18/nycs-new-vessel-landmark-has-a-big-photo-copyright-grab/
https://old.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/b2pf5o/vessel_at_hudson_yards_photo_policy_sparks_online/
"yeah, I've been learning more about how places are restricting photography and photographers. For instance, some resorts require wedding photographers to pay them in order to do photo work at their resort."
"I guess it doesn't matter, but it seems annoying. If I had the time and money I would make an art career violating their damn contracts and laws I guess."
and then there are places of natural beauty getting trashed cuz too many folks go there and/or share gps coordinates.
"I love taking advantage of photo ops, but I guess it's better to appreciate the little personal things in life that would otherwise go unappreciated. So much to love that we may not be trained to appreciate."
WOW! Can't an update from Warren Wimmer! Did anybody take Chicago to court?
What is it’s purpose? Honestly I’m confused here
It's weird and useless but I'm glad it exists. It's good to see that not everything has a functional purpose and creating weird and useless stuff is what makes us human.
Damn you're right. Let's get rid of central park too.
"wow, well way to take my comment about as far out of context as you possibly could have taken it.  I meant that it's impressive that someone would invest this much space to a public usable art/space.  Who the hell said anything about getting rid of anything, I noted that it adds a new layer because land is expensive in manhattan esp over there"
And it looks like you get a decent view
"It’s a center piece of the public plaza in Hudson Yards. Which is a rapidly developing area in NYC full of high end retail, housing, etc in tall high rise buildings. It’s just public space to explore"
I'll copy and paste what I wrote in another thread:
The whole point of this thing is to be shared as much as possible and draw attention to their hyper-expensive bullshit for hyper-rich fuckwads
"Added bonus - they also own all the ""sales/for-profit"" rights to the pictures taken from inside/on the steps themselves per the fine print no one reads upon entering the structure. Someone on their PR team is on reddit. Don't believe the downvotes."
You have to be hyper rich to enter it?
Bernie Sanders should do a speech in front of this bastard. It will play great to highlight the record income inequality we have in this country.....shit just in that city
Meta
What is it’s purpose?
""
To be a tourist trap.
I know it's a grandiose monument in the middle of a massive gated community for the ultra-rich but it still looks cool and I'd still climb it the next time I'm in Manhattan
This could be a textbook cover for some kind of group dynamics class.
Not a bad exercise.
THATS SO COOL HOW HAVE I NEVER BEEN THERE?!!?
Can you get in without reserving a spot yet?
They have same day tickets available at 9 30 according to their website.
Edit: available on site
"There is a ton of criticism about this thing (most of it justified imo) but the thing I haven't seen anyone point out is that there could be future development over those train tracks in the background.  If that happens then this thing is rendered completely pointless because there is no view and it would essentially just be in a big courtyard,"
I dont care to see Jersey either
In fact let's put the building up in front of it faster
There has bee very little criticism
Source: I live in New York and work near this thing
"No, there's a ton of criticism. Mostly from idiots and NIMBYs."
"I would disagree.  There has been a ton of criticism yes, but most of what I have seen is from architectural and city planning circles. It is also fueled by a general dislike of the Hudson Yards as a whole which is giving huuuge tax breaks to corporations to lure jobs from mid town over to the new development."
Hudson Yards is in Midtown. They didn't get any tax breaks that everyone doesn't get
"All new development gets some sort of tax break, everywhere"
I also live in New York so my statement was more about semantics.  The tax breaks were given in order for companies to move from more traditional areas of Midtown.  And I understand that tax breaks are normal but the scope of them can be debated and people can rightly criticize them.
Haven't seen any except a bit on reddit
Liar
???
An intergalactic version of humans came back in time to give us the plans for this.
nyc number one!!
My buddies just transferred from over there. It was a brutal winter putting that thing together.
I hope a chase scene in a movie is filmed here someday.
"""The Vessel"" is actually just a working title. The best proposal for the official name is ""The Big Shawarma."""
"Should have called it ""Vesselly McVessel-Face"""
"FYI the mall is shyte, everyone was packed into the Shake Shack while every single other store was completely empty."
"Thanks, I hate it"
nice
Visually pleasing omggg
My knees are cramping just looking at this
"The whole Hudson Yards project feels like it should and could be in Dallas. It does not feel very New York to me...especially the mall interiors. And the Vessel is exactly the kind of showy, pretentious kind of thing Dallas does with their civic architecture. It’s all beautiful, but it’s not New York."
You could say the same thing about the WTC and that’s one of the most iconic New York landmarks.
"Yeah, but it’s all white inside. We’ll have it trashed in a couple of years."
Okay so am I the only one that thinks this thing looks like the covenant structure in one of the Halo cutscenes when the Arbiter was getting punished or whatever?
Been here once but did not look like this. I must be seeing it wrong
Paging Mr. Escher.
The Shawarma
"""Hey new guy! Boss wants you to go sweep the stairs"""
Scrolling down the picture fast while looking at it makes u dizzy
Dysphoria
Is this what bees sees from inside of the beehive?
I met the inventor of a vase that was shaped just like this. Cool.
It's for that.
"Two men enter, one man leaves."
Ooof!  Who arted?
Looks like a good workout imo. I would be down to walking this.
I dont understand how this thing costs $200M to build.  The thing is less than 10 floors high.  That means it costs $20M per floor for concrete and steel and a few electrical wires.  Even if all the steps were escalators id still think it's overpriced.  Are they factoring the land costs and air costs into the $200M?  Because in just raw materials and labor the this half-ass not even a whole building should be $10M-20M at most.
Is this because of union rules installing a door knob has a flat rate of 20hours or are mobsters pocketing the money?
In China they could probably build this for $1M dollars.
This thing looks like a landing zone for some alien spaceship. I don't get this design at all.
just gonna throw this reference in & hope i dont get downvoted to oblivion: No cost too great
I'm calling it now: someone is going to die on this thing within a year either intentionally or not.
"All right, new suicide hotspot!"
Honestly this was my first thought upon seeing this picture...
Because we needed this over a stadium🙄
"Oh, look, fancy stairs!"
Can’t believe there’s a waiting list for this thing
isnt this pic illegal? i know that hudson yards has the right to post a cease and desist or something
I feel like this is trying too hard to be a landmark.
Thanks for the headache! 😅
Why?
This photo is owned by the  management company.  As are all photos of the vessel.
