There must be a better PR way of saying this lol.

"Also for the first time, previously free-all-day tickets will be $10 for visitors above 5 years old after the first hour of each day‚Äôs opening times."
Who‚Äôs gonna go to this thing now that you have to pay for it?
Instagram influencers and tiktok stars
"Honestly (unpopular I know), I would. I walked it when it first opened in 2019 and I liked it. I won‚Äôt be walking it frequently, but it was enjoyable. 10 buck entry fee does make me mad, especially since they promised it‚Äôd be free, but I will still begrudgingly shell out."
Edit: been living in NYC for a decade.
"When it opened, I walked up it to check it out and I have living in NYC since 10 years now."
"Yes, you must come in groups and pay 10 bucks each...for safety."
This lowkey reads like an invitation to an orgy.

I had one of those conversations you have when you're high with a friend and came up with a gang bang scenario where guys must come up the steps to meet the pornstar at the top by the elevator and on e the guy has his turn he may take the elevator down
std assembly line
How long until Ticketmaster adds an anti-suicide fee?
There are nets in there now??
I remember the plexiglass! I once went to take a phone call in the hallway on the 5th floor (this was like 8 or so years ago) and a security guard approached me because I had looked like I was loitering. Apparently you aren't allowed to spend a lot of time in those hallways that overlook the lobby because well...you know.
Yes... for... safe... ty
good now my friends can help throw me over the side
Smiles required. No masks.
"You have to imagine there was someone in the planning meeting who piped up with ""people are going to throw themselves off this thing"", and everyone else was like ""nah, you're crazy!"""
As someone who does activities solo instead of being depressed at home this is pretty discouraging. People who do things solo don‚Äôt need discriminatory reminders of how lonely they are.
Yeah this is a little upsetting. I have solo travelled overseas and it's great to check out the sites by yourself. I feel bad for the Europeans and others who come to visit NYC and won't be able to do this. On the plus side maybe this means they'll have a little nudge to get them to make friends in their hostel or wherever to check this out?
"It's a really bizarre and pointless policy. And discriminatory. I much prefer doing this kind of stuff on my own, and now I can't? Whaaaa? Why would you alienate so many potential visitors? Very disappointing."
"I'm visiting NYC soon to see my kid. I have a whole Friday to myself until. She gets off work. As a foodie, I wanted to make a reservation for lunch and to my surprise, Resy will show tables for two, but when I search for one, there aren't any. Sucks."
Maybe try calling the restaurant directly? Sometimes that works. Good luck!
"I will, thanks!"

My point is that people being solo or w/ someone has nothing to do w/ whether they will attempt suicide or not. A young teen came w/ his family and he still jumped.

I think the suicides are incredibly sad. But the solution to stopping them is not to ban solo visitors.
"We live in the age of the internet dude, just post on a forum like this one and find someone to go with. Not that hard"
"I think the point is I PREFER to do stuff like this alone. I enjoy going to art museums on my own. I take long walks on my own. I have a ton of friends and I'm outgoing, but I like my solo outings!"
""
They need to stop people from killing themselves. I think that need is probably greater than the rights of singles to go up high on their property
The point is how does banning solo visitors actually prevent suicide? How many solo travelers went there and did not commit suicide?  It‚Äôs a bad policy.
if only solo visitors are killing themselves then even with the dimmest logic banning solo visitors WILL prevent all the suicides.
THIS!!!
""
Let's all hope joint suicides don't happen.
i am a loner. i have no friends. how am i suppose to go here now?
find a new place. Never give up on your dreams.
"They did you a favor, now you can do something fun in NYC that isn't vertical Times Square."
"I wonder if there was a copycat aspect to it. IIRC, the last two suicides happened fairly close to one another."
"the worst thing is the risk to innocent people on the ground- what about them?  And can you imagine the trauma of someone landing a few feet away?  Omg,  I wouldn't be right for a long time after that!"
"I was curious if anyone would post this. This is . . . upsetting? Discriminatory? I'm a social, outgoing person but I prefer to do my sightseeing on my own. And now I can't do this? I understand that suicide is very tragic and I'm not making light of it, but how many solo visitors were there who did NOT die by suicide there?"
It seems like banning solo visitors is overkill and it concerns me that other organizations/spaces/etc would enact similar policies. This is not good.
Agreed. Well said
"This is ridiculous. Suicide is a terrible thing, but you can't ruin something because of the acts of a very despondent few."
you can't ruin something because of the acts of a very despondent few.
That's pretty much how we ruin everything good.
Sooner or later one of these poor souls will land on a group of school children.  I'm putting this out there for discussion.
"It's discriminatory. I know that might sound overly dramatic, but it is."
"Marital status is a protected class, but this doesn't discriminate based on whether you have a partner or not. People can go with friends or relatives."
"Fair enough, may not be legally considered discriminatory. But I do think there is something very ethically wrong about not letting solo visitors go. It makes no sense. If a pair goes together, what stops one person from pushing the other over the railing? It's bizarre and sets a terrible precedent."
It does set a precedent- next they'll be forcing someone into the bathroom stall with you!
Maybe homeless people could be hired out for a few dollars to accompany solitary people up there.  I could see that becoming a thing
"We all agree.  But will you agree that at some point, action has to be taken if it's more than a few?   Just for the sake of discussion, what if 5 people jump in the month of August?"
"I live up in CT where they have closed swimming holes forever because people have drowned.  And people keep walking out on a sand bar in my town, and then drown when the tide comes in.  It's one of the nicest walks in the state, and people are calling for it to be off limits."
That's different.  That's an inherent hazard.
"Is three suicides a year really a ""rash"" of suicides?"
At a single public location? Yes.
"It is far less than the GW Bridge,  Verrazano and old Tappan Zee Bridge. So I'm not sure what you're comparing it to."
I'm comparing it to other building in NYC. Jumping off a structure endangers people on the ground.
"You want to jump off a bridge, be my guest. You are unlikely to harm someone else. Jump off a building and the body has to hit the pavement."
Any building getting 3 jumpers a year should take serious precautions to lower that number.
""
Anyone can go to a landmark while not anyone can just walk into a random high-rise and have access to a roof or balcony. So you can only compare like with like.
"He also came right down where I believe the gas tank is, can you imagine surviving the fall and then consciously being burned alive?"
The Vessel is such a poor suicide option. Pedestrians below mean there is a danger of injuring/killing someone and dozens of people will bear witness to the decedent's selfish act.
"""rash"""
"I suppose a person can kill themselves without needing to be here, but this certainly is a more demonstrative way to do it."
"I disagree with this.  I have travelled by myself many times.  And sometimes when I am on work trip or trip with others, I will want to do things that others don't want to do, so I still end up seeing some sites or places by myself..."
at least its back open
"if it's that problematic why not convert the exhibit to a nature display. convert the levels/stairs into areas where plants can grow, let vines hang over, etc. only allow people to the ground floor + first level. that'll look pretty cool."
better doing something with it than tearing it down or having ridiculous policies for entry imo.
$10 isn‚Äôt gonna stop anyone from killing them selves
I'm not sure what they were thinking designing this thing.
whether it was half empty or half full
Next up: Couples jumping off of the Vessel.
Suicidal people ruin everything.
"Currently the Port Authority is being sued over a suicide from one of their bridges. If they lose, you're right (at least under similar circumstances to this case). If they win, you're wrong."

Huh? What is that supposed to mean? People can jump off pretty much any other building or similar tourist attraction. So thry dont do it here‚Ä¶ the jump off the high line instead. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How do you stop someone from killing themselves if thats that they are dead set on doing.
"I work in a psychiatric facility, when people decide The want to kill themselves, nothing you build can stop them."
Never planned on visiting that shrine to capitalist greed in the first place ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"I don‚Äôt understand this viewpoint. Would you rather the capitalists spent that $200M on a Picasso or a yacht for their sole enjoyment? Lots of monuments and museums are financed by capitalists, including Little Island. Sucks not to be rich, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to spite them."
I think they‚Äôre referring to Hudson Yards as a whole.
This entire city is a literal shrine to capitalism. Just because I was born here and I live here doesn't mean I have to agree with or like our economic system of system of governance.
You need to give up conscious thought.  It's not working out for you.
Stupid tourist trap.
Now you have to make a suicide pack with someone to get up there.
Pack!  Haha
It's too bad that ugly pile of garbage will never get torn down because its main purpose has always been to act as a monument to the wealth of it's funders.
"I kind of assumed since the whole vibe of the place is ""PLEB-FREE ZONE NO PLEBS ALLOWED"" that the presence of a large, human-scale wastebasket wasn't coincidental."
1st NYPost article I‚Äôve seen allowed in weeks
""
"So, some Texan murderer jumps and we pay the price.."
"Funny, it‚Äôs the nypost that makes me want to jump from tall buildings, not ugly architecture."
"It's exactly the right-leaning narrative people should read, since you're fed leftist tripe the other 99% of the time."
Isn't this old news? I thought the ban went into effect after the last person jumped.
Teamwork makes the dream work!
