"Architect: Hm, I just can't figure out how I want the top floors of the building to look"
""
Architect: ...it's genius
""
And the architect who designed it passed away yesterday
"Yeah this tower looks like shit, the transition ratios/curves whatever you want to call them are really uncomfortable, for me at least. I like the staggered glass on the bottom but everything else feels like making a boring tower worse."
""
"Interesting. It could have been more than mundane, yeah."
"Lazy is a very good way to describe the transition, yeah that design is definitely more coherent and interesting."
"It's somewhat comforting to know that value engineering still happens in the high-and-mighty New York City, and isn't just something that besets Toronto on all sides..."
"What.. is actually inside? Near as I can tell, it’s a CrossFit instructor’s Escherian dream, all endless stairways."
It's just staircase after staircase lol
To the tune of $150 million. What would have happened if that had gone to the poor of NYC?
They would each get like $75
For how long?
lol
There’s sometimes classes on the Vessel in the AM from Equinox gym.
Man that glass building is like someone figured out how to use the blend tool in Revit lmao.
EDIT: what the hell is that top profile tho lmaooooo
Fuck the Vessel.
"The amount of hate for this thing is absolutely absurd, lmao. I agree that there's a broader issue with real estate developments catering to the super rich and the Hudson Yards development as a whole deserves criticism for continuing that trend."
"But why would you so aggressively single out a real estate development that repurposes disused space and provides some not-insignificant public goods? And why would you single out the publicly accessible components of Hudson Yards? It seems like people are largely ignoring the most problematic aspects of HY so that they can be contrarian about a popular piece of art. It also seems like HY gets way more hate than all of Billionaire's Row, which hasn't provided a single public good other than expanding the MoMA (which charges $14+ for admission...)."
"I guess the point about accessibility is valid, but at the end of the day it would have been a very different looking structure if the whole thing had been designed with ramps instead of stairs...and even with ramps, I doubt that people with disabilities would be flocking to climb a 16 story structure...at the end of the day large climbable art is inevitably going to be biased towards people with fully-functioning legs."
It has an elevator for disabled visitors.
Band-aid for a bullet wound.
"Which takes you a level below the top. I realize they didn't want the elevator shafts to be the dominant feature, but come on."
""
""
"I'm not really sure how it's ""putting the project's ideology out there more than any other part."" Sure, it's the most visible/recognizable part of the development, but is a public-access piece of art really the best encapsulation of HY's problematic neoliberal ideology?"
""
"I agree, there is definitely more to it than the vessel itself. But, I think it would be hard to argue that they are doing anything virtuous, even a little. Normally you would be right that the line between signaling and otherwise is blurry,but its pretty clear here. I'm  grasping to find the merit that you hint at."
"If I recall correctly, the project used public funds, but the reality of ""public"" here sits somewhere between art (I'll leave the debate on the merit of it as art aside) exclusively for the rich and Instagram pics that the developer owns the rights to."
"What? You think it’s hard to argue that a large, publicly accessible sculpture has ANY virtue? I have a hard time taking that seriously. It’s a piece of art, just because you don’t personally like it and what it stands for doesn’t mean people aren’t enjoying it for what it is. Providing something of value to the public is virtuous, even if you personally place little value on the thing."
"And it’s not exclusively for the rich...Poor people can and do access it. The fact that people initially didn’t have exclusive rights to profit from their IG pics (this has since been changed) doesn’t mean they weren’t getting anything out of it...it’s a little ridiculous to act like that temporary IP hiccup (which, to my knowledge, didn’t actually impact anyone) completely cancelled out any potential enjoyment that people could get from it."
publicly accessible
"It isn't, though."
It's only for the able bodied.
"You have to have a ticket to get in, which you have to buy ahead of time, or try to get one of the same day tickets, which are free but limited in number."
"You assume that every day people are just walking around Hudson Yards. I have a hard time believing that's true. If it's anything more than a place for the rich, it doesn't go much farther than being a place for tourists."
"Here, I pulled a quote from the article shared in the comment at the top of this thread:"
"It is a Vessel for a so-called neighborhood that poorly masks its intention to build luxury assets for the criminally wealthy under the guise of investing in the city and “public space.” What is public space if not that land allocated (thanks to the generosity of our Real Estate overlords) to the city’s undeserving plebeians, who can interface with it in one of two ways: as consumers or interlopers, both allowed only to play from dawn ‘til dusk in the discarded shadows of the ultra-rich? Unlike a real neighborhood, which implies some kind of social collaboration or collective expression of belonging, Hudson Yards is a contrived place that was never meant for us."
It has an elevator. Would you say a playground in a park isn’t publicly accessible if it’s not fully wheelchair accessible?
"Of course they control access for safety, but ultimately it’s free. You’re just quibbling at this point."
The fact that it might not be in the most convenient location for everyone in NYC doesn’t mean it’s not a public space. Nobody said it was the platonic ideal of a public space.
"Just because that article says it wasn’t “meant” for us doesn’t mean that it’s true, and it certainly doesn’t mean that the public hasn’t derived enjoyment from it...."
""
"I think the playground is a useful example. Of course the Vessel is more expensive, but that's beside the point. We're not talking about whether it was an ideal or efficient use of public funds, we're asking whether the piece has any value/virtue/etc for the general public. Which it absolutely does. The fact that it could be more accessible doesn't change that. The fact that it doesn't fit your ideal criteria for what public art should be doesn't change that."
"Whether or not the piece's virtue is a ""intentional"" is also beside the point - you're getting mixed up between the virtue of the HY Developers and the virtue of the Vessel itself. The Vessel's virtues (aesthetics, enjoyability) will exist regardless of whether they were conferred intentionally or not. You can impugn the motives of the developer all you want, it doesn't have any bearing on the inherent virtues of the Vessel. These virtues aren't a ""sham"" regardless of how duplicitous you think the HY developers are."
""
"For the record, I agree with a lot of your criticisms of HY and the Vessel. I just think you're being hyperbolic."
And arguably it was designed as a tank trap to deter the public from entering what would otherwise be a public space.
Edit: I tend to agree with Wagner's unfavourable comparison of the development to the Rockefeller Centre
"Apart from anything else, it's designed by Heatherwick a man who specialises in supremely useless, suspiciously expensive and surprisingly shoddy structures. It's one thing when he's leeching off the rich like here, but most of his disasters are a drain on the public purse, like the B in the Bang was and the Garden Bridge would have been if it had been built"
That's my objection to it
"I mean it’s art, of course it’s useless in most conventional senses."
"Heatherwicks work is only art if you consider being expensive, useless and dangerous as central artistic qualities."
Edgy take
What art do you consider “useful”?
"Well you can start by not degrading the surrounding public spaces, like his work tends to do. The park surrounding the B in the Bang had to be closed until they removed it because it kept shedding spikes."
EDIT: And the Garden Bridge would have been a blight on the Thames and also inaccesible to disabled people.
"Ok, if you have evidence of the Vessel shedding dangerous materials, I'd love to hear about it!"
"I'm not trying to defend Heatherwick in any general sense. If you have beef with the guy, fine, I'm not going to get in the way of that. I'm just trying to have a reasonable conversation about the Vessel that doesn't act like the thing is a giant upside down burning cross."
"Surprisingly for a Heatherwick structure, it isn't falling apart yet, despite apparently being as shoddily built as usual. But you have to admit it's even more of a blot on the landscape than the rest of the Hudson Yards, which is mostly a strange mixture of depressingly and aggressively unimaginative."
EDIT: I do hope the standards of the finishes in those buildings are slightly higher than on the Wastebasket
"I don't know if I ""have"" to admit that. I'm not trying to say the thing is above criticism. It's far from my favourite public sculpture. But, I personally think it's interesting looking, and I'd like to have the opportunity to climb up it. I think Hudson Yards is an awkward, sterile-looking jumble of steel and glass. But I still would be interested to visit given the chance, and the Vessel is no small part of that. You're calling it a ""blot"" as if that settles the argument..."
"And I guess you can call it ""unimaginative"" if you want, since it was inspired by Indian step-wells? But most pieces of art has a source of inspiration. And as far as I know, no artist before him has thought to make an above-ground interpretation of a step well?"
"What do you mean ""shoddily built""?"
What the heck lol
"The tower's giving off futurist vibes, i dig it"
Where is this?
Hudson Yards in Manhattan
"I realized immidiately after typing that ""15 Hudson Yard"" likely is a place."
"Sorry. But thanks for clearing up it´s in Manhattan, a friend of mine claimed it´s in China."
Your friend is a complete cockwomble.
Very accurate.
I work there!
Fr? Can you describe it? I always wondered what people do at those types of places.
I work in a financial firm but can't necessarily tell what others in the building do.
"As far as how it is, place is really nice! Really modern on the inside and its next to a really nice mall. Right next to the entrance to the 7 train too."
Dope!
"Hey everybody. Just wanted to say that as an architecture student, I find the discussion here very stimulating."
Now if they could just plant a couple redwood trees in the middle or plant some ivy on the darned thing.
This is amazing.
Who said late stage capitalism doesnt have some positive products?
"Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah"
