He was 14 with his family. One of the new policy‚Äôs was to not allow solo visitors. Security said he was laughing with his sister right before he jumped.
I'm wondering if he knew he was going to jump from the moment he saw it or if he had that feeling of doing so and just acted on it
"This. Whenever I'm at great heights looking down getting sweaty palms I wonder what it would feel like to fall. The anxiety and curiosity collide. In a young mind, reason easily can lose that internal struggle."

"Thank you, I knew there was a name for it."
Poe called it the ‚Äúimp of the perverse.‚Äù From his story called the same:
"‚ÄúWe stand upon the brink of a precipice. We peer into the abyss‚Äîwe grow sick and dizzy. Our first impulse is to shrink away from the danger. Unaccountably we remain... it is but a thought, although a fearful one, and one which chills the very marrow of our bones with the fierceness of the delight of its horror. It is merely the idea of what would be our sensations during the sweeping precipitancy of a fall from such a height... for this very cause do we now the most vividly desire it.‚Äù"
Damn. Talk about mastering the English language.
"It's almost like that vessel was designed to facilitate that feeling. Enough people visit, eventually someone is going to jump."
"Yes..it was actually pretty predictable that something like this would happen, regrettably. I'm not involved in safety or planning, I'm just a regular bro, but even I knew this would be the result. I'm thinking the guys that gave the green light were not too bright."

Yeah I cannot ride that escalator. Getting on the 7 line Hudson yards escalators without knowing how fucking long they are broke something in my brain and now I can't get on any longer than like 1.5 flights without starting to feel dizzy.

I tandem skydive once and at that edge your mind is making a lot of decisions.
I jumped cause I know I was attached to someone qualified and I would get down safely.

Not suicidal at all but sometimes when I‚Äôm up really high I get a quick urge to jump.  Makes no sense at all but I guess I‚Äôm not the only one
"With suicidal intent, especially in teenagers, it's often an impulse that's spur of the moment and intimately linked to availability of means. One of the best ways to prevent suicide, in teenagers especially but also often in older people, is to do nothing more than interrupt that impulse. Obviously you also have to treat the underlying condition, but just short-circuiting the opportunity-driven impulse is enough to get one more day."
"The Oculus does the opposite - it's basically a screaming impulse-driver. Between the sheer drama of it, the call of the void aspect, and the ease of doing it, it's like a giant neon ""jump, motherfucker"" sign. Frankly, it's shocking this isn't more common."
perhaps they should allow only 21+ to enter The Vessel.
Or they could just integrate the barriers designed by the artist themselves. Or better yet they can take it down and replace it with something that isn't an bland and uninspired monument to consumerism in its most mediocre form.
2 of the 4 suicides were 21+
Okay so that would have prevented 50% of them
Apparently he'd just been told off by the security guard for running. Sounds crazy but that's the kind of thing that can send a mentally ill or sensitive kid over the edge. It sucks to be laughing one minute then in trouble with an adult the next when you're a kid. Kinda humiliating. Now imagine if you're struggling with suicidal feelings of worthlessness every day. One possibility anyway.
i know what u mean. you are almost courting the slightest reason to justify to yourself why youll do what youd been meaning to do for a long time now
"I know when I've been in dark times, the most trivial things like a small complaint from a customer in my business could put me in a funk for days."
That's a weird response to the point I was making tbh. Telling someone off is telling them off whether it's your job or not.
"""telling off"" is different from being yelled at. I've been yelled at numerous times as a kid by the lifeguards at the pool for running. there was nothing about it, but if you're sensitive, then it can be seen as them telling you off."
"""Telling off"" covers a wide range including being yelled at and being told firmly not to do something. You're absolutely splitting hairs and being petty, obtuse and contrary for the sake of creating unnecessary conflict in a discussion. Get over it."
I did not read that as him blaming the security guard for the suicide -- only that he/she may have unintentionally triggered it.
There's always gotta be someone who can't just have a normal conversation huh
That's dumb and i guarantee you no one else thinks of it like that.
I think like that.
I also think you're the dumb one for thinking that the way you phrase something is automatically the way that it should be phrased and that words can mean only what you think they should mean.
"I don't even know what your problem with the phrase is. When you're a kid and an adult in authority tells you to stop doing something that's against the rules, that's being told off. It's a bigger deal when you're a kid then when you're an adult."
My words meant enough to you (and i assume others) for you to delete your comment.
"It's not dumb, what is wrong with you. I used quite standard English to describe something in a completely non judgemental way. I wasn't saying the security guard was to blame. Just pointing out that little things can trigger people who are mentally ill (as you yourself seem to be demonstrating here)"
"Didn't insult you at all. Since when was ""mentally ill"" an insult?"
So now it‚Äôs the security guards fault? Or should we blame the parents?
Who says it's anyone's fault? I simply pointed out that seemingly trivial things can trigger someone who's depressed. Why are you making this an issue of blame.
I think the Vessel decided and told him to do it.
Probably thought he would respawn back at the entrance. The really sad part is good parents will forever question every decision and they ever made concerning him and wondering what signs they missed.
Suicidal people will often show elevated mood after they have decided to commit suicide. It's likely he decided to do this after knowing they were going to the site.
What you say is true.
"My roommate was down in the dumps for like a week straight wouldn't leave his room, talk to anyone, shower, or do his laundry. Then on the day he jumped off the roof he called his girlfriend and they have a nice conversation about this they were going to do, travel, get married, etc. Cleaned his room. Paid his parking ticket. Made plans to have basketball game with friends in a few days."
It's very bizarre. I've never been down that road so I don't really know what to make of it.

"It's hope. When you're deep in a pit of darkness, depression, hopelessness, you suffer in the misery. You feel that you're a prisoner. That you're never escape."
Then it dawns on you. You do have a way to escape the pain.
"Most people are afraid of death. But when you're at your lowest point you're afraid of spending one more day in that psychological place. In your head, jumping is your ticket out."
Pay his parking tickets is the most odd part of this story. -Not to make lite of this I'm sure it is traumatizing to all near to him.
I would guess he didnt want to leave any sort of burden on his loved ones
"I think making plans and talking about getting married are odder.  I get that he was trying to clean things up for his family to not have to deal with, but the plans are weirder"
sorry to hear. was this recent?
That‚Äôs horrible.
Yes totally true
So sad
Cant imagine seeing this happen if on the ground at the time.  Devastating.

"Turn it upside down, I think that'd make for an ironic sculpture"
That would actually be a pretty neat statement. Probably wouldn't be justifiable given the expensive real estate.
Turning it upside down would just mean you‚Äôd jump from the opposite direction.
"I‚Äôve never been there but it looks like it expands outwards so you couldn‚Äôt jump from inside, you‚Äôd hit the next level. You‚Äôd jump from the outside. If you flipped it upside you‚Äôd jump from the inside."
I think they meant turn it upside down and flip the concept of it being something people could walk on inside out

Tell me if you hate it.
Saw something similar in a videogame where a staircase takes you up the full length of the tree.
The concept is fine. People clearly enjoyed going in there and experiencing it. The issue is they chose to not install vertical barriers before opening or after the first suicide inside the Vessel. They fucked up big time.
"Why does the whole world need to be suicide proofed? Ultimately if someone wants to commit suicide, that is their decision, tragic though it may be, but why should we have to re-engineer something like the Vessel just because a few people out of the millions of visitors decide to jump to their deaths?"

"Putting that aside, think of all the other places someone could jump to their deaths in this city. What about the Guggenheim? Those walls are pretty short by modern standards, surely someone could jump to their death there, if they haven't already in its long history."

Potentially harming innocent bystanders on the ground is one argument for preventing someone from throwing themselves off of a building. It's the same reason people need to secure their window a.c. units and why the city requires scaffolding during construction. Just because someone has the freedom to take their own life does not mean we shouldn't attempt to stop them from harming themselves AND others.
"They're not saying we shouldn't attempt to stop them. They're saying that suicide is a mental health problem and needs to be addressed as one rather than just idiot proofing one physical spot. If you read the full response, they have added more details."

"After the fourth public case of suicide, ‚ÄúIf‚Äù is doing some mighty big lifting in that statement."
That idea is being cemented into the public conscience at the speed of QuickSet Cement dries.
"While 4 suicides is ‚Äúa lot‚Äù I guess, it should always be displayed as suicides (x) over people who used it as intended (y), because that should keep the thing in perspective. 50,000-90,000 visitors daily (via Google) for several years. 4 suicides straight up doesn‚Äôt bother me and wouldn‚Äôt stop me from going at all. We‚Äôre talking 4 people of a plausible 36,000,000-73,000,000 over the last two years. Now what, it has to be retrofitted with ugly nets and high barriers, punishing everyone who wanted to experience it as it is?"
"This is like that one ‚Äúshoe bomber‚Äù incident 20 years ago, resulting in millions of people a year take off their shoes at airport security, adding extra stress and annoyance, slowing down the flow of people,  for two decades. Because of one asshole."
It feels like a wild overreaction to me personally.
Yeah it may be too far gone at this point unless they can somehow get it to be known for something else instead.
And do you know how many people jump off the GWB or Brooklyn bridge? Factually a lot more. Where's the outrage? Where's the clamoring to make those bridges suicide proof? That's what I thought...
"This is a free country. It's sad people want to resort to suicide, but if that's what they want, that's their right."
Where's the clamoring to make those bridges suicide proof? That's what I thought...
Maybe wait a minute before claiming victory lol. Im not an expert on suicide prevention but I know for a fact there are at least some suicide prevention measures taken on bridges ranging from barriers to signs with helplines.
The decision is barriers or public perception of a suicide magnet. I think barriers are fine but if you reallly want to you should go put up your signs pointing to more popular locations to commit suicide.
"I am pointing out the faux outrage and virtue signaling Reddit is so famous for. Way more people jump from the Brooklyn Bridge or the GWB, but lets focus on the Vessel. Did you know there is an suicide attempt every 3.5 fucking days on the GWB? That's 100 attempts a YEAR."
bridges ranging from barriers to signs with helplines.
"And people still jump. Why isn't there any talk of far higher barriers, or even closing it down the walkways and offering free buses?"
"Displaying any sense of human decency on reddit these days always brings out the ""VIRTUE SIGNALINGGGGG!!1"" crowd."
"Believe it or not, many people are good people with good virtues. To believe that they're somehow faking it or only saying it to be popular says a lot about your virtues as a human"
I dont really understand your point. How many suicides do we need to allow before anyone is able to comment
"Why isn't there any talk of far higher barriers,"
How can you even claim you know this isn't happening/never happens? And there ARE barriers on bridges and NO barriers on the vessel. So...
offering free buses
youre so funny
And do you know how many people jump off the GWB or Brooklyn bridge?
Bridges are vital pieces infrastructure. A cool looking art installation isn't.
Where's the clamoring to make those bridges suicide proof? That's what I thought...
"They've already done this, and continue to do this. Don't you notice the fences that are obviously put up to stop people from jumping? They were put there after the public clamoring many years ago, and they add/improve sections every year"
"This is a free country. It's sad people want to resort to suicide, but if that's what they want, that's their right."
I agree. But they shouldn't be allowed to put other people in danger by doing so. Jumping off something tall means you won't necessarily know if you'll land on and kill a non-suicidal person
"I thought about this when I wrote my first comment, it's indirectly addressed already:"
The entire point of the Vessel is its public perception
"Bridges have a clear purpose (transportation) that vastly overshadows the public perception of suicides; the Vessel has no similar ""purpose"". That's why it's not in the news as much, not because of virtue signaling."
""
"Perhaps a callous question, but in this case I think the answer is even more so.  Hudson Yards is a private development and the Vessel is its trademark.  A lot of people spent a lot of money on Hudson Yards, and they do not want their brand to be synonymous with suicide, which is already happening regardless of whatever the statistical risk may be.  Installing some chicken wire might prevent the next grim headline."
I think it is pointless to try to address the problem at physical point of suicide. We can reduce risk at one location but it does nothing overall.
""
Potential to harm bystanders both physically and mentally is significant.
"I wouldn‚Äôt go to a place if I knew I was risking seeing someone jump to their death, nor would I want to work somewhere where I may have to scrub up someone‚Äôs blood."
"Even if you are ok with someone‚Äôs choice to end their life, the manner in which they do it can greatly impact the lives of others."
"The Vessel is very public and has high foot traffic around the base. This means that when someone jumps, dozens of unsuspecting members of the public will be traumatized. Yes, we cannot prevent every suicide but we can prevent suicides at this very public location."
"Studies have shown that preventing access to a means of suicide will significantly reduce a person's chance of actually killing themselves.  The drive to kill yourself can be deterred simply by inconvenience, and it can fade if there's no 'easy' method to do it.  Jumping off of something is an 'easy' method, and barriers are a straightforward way of keeping people from going through with what might be a passing impulse."
"You're not only being callous, you're being ill-informed.  And on top of that, maybe other people don't want to watch someone drop to their death while they're visiting Hudson Yard."
"EDIT: you‚Äôre all absolutely right, we should absolutely preserve the aesthetic of this beautiful building by littering it with the corpses of jumpers, you fucking ghouls"
"Exactly.  Plus, the desire to kill oneself will subside materially once one has left Hudson Yards."
Hahahahaha.  I love this comment so hard
"It is nice though, in a perverse way, that they provided you with a convenient wastebasket to deposit yourself into."
I think they're perhaps ill informed but not callous... Assuming what you're saying is correct. Those are all legitimate points.
"I mean, say adequate barriers were installed at the vessel, would that really be considered reducing suicide access when the subway most people take to get to the vessel is still there?"
I get how blocking off bridges and gun/pesticide control would work- without a bridge a ordinarily a person would have to go out of their way to find another high platform to jump from.
Good thing NYC doesn't have any bridges
"I understand that, those studies are pointed out every time this issue comes up on Reddit. What I‚Äôm saying is that it isn‚Äôt always worth it, from a pure cost/benefit perspective, to essentially ‚Äúbubble wrap‚Äù every place one could conceivably commit suicide. The same argument could be made about every publicly accessible place that includes heights."
"This is doubly true of something like the Vessel, which is essentially a giant sculpture. Adding barriers will surely harm its aesthetics. You didn‚Äôt address the other examples, such as the Guggenheim or the Grand Canyon. Should the Guggenheim have to install plexiglass barriers to prevent one suicide out of 10 million visitors, even if it destroys the architectural aesthetic of Frank Loyd Wright? The Grand Canyon or Niagara Falls are even better examples‚Äîwould the natural vista be as enjoyable if you had to see it through plexiglass or a chain link fence? The Vessel is the same as these examples. It isn‚Äôt some elevated hotel or train station walkway that the general public has to pass through just to get to work, it‚Äôs basically a giant art piece that exists for its own aesthetic value. I just don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to expect such a place to be fully ‚Äúsuicide proofed‚Äù."
Every suicide is also potentially the death of a bystander on the ground who gets fallen on. Would you say a building that has 150+ pounds fall off the top of it every 6 months doesn't need an engineering solution? It's the same with the vessel.
In addition to the trauma of seeing someone splatter on the ground. It can be horrific and nobody should have to be exposed to that.
It would be easier and less aesthetically intrusive to simply close the base to bystanders and install some sort of entryway that‚Äôs shielded from jumpers.
"Lol I don't know what you do for a living, but it's certainly not Branding or Marketing"
It would be easier and less aesthetically intrusive to simply close the base to bystanders and install some sort of entryway that‚Äôs shielded from jumpers.
"Seeing that install would be my 13th reason, Jesus."
You didn't answer his question though
Also you have to think of the first responders. Should we be subjecting them to constant calls to tend to jumpers dead on the ground?
"Hey there EMT,  I know we could invest in reducing your trauma by putting up some barriers but they don't look nice so just clean this up. All this for $35K a year."
Yes they see car accidents and other traumatic events but since we don't provide mental health support we can at least try to minimize the amount of dead people they're exposed to.
Also pure 9/11 vibes. The one day I wasn't at work was on 9/11 and my coworkers told me the sound a person makes when hitting the ground. No one should have to experience that if we can put the absolute minimum in.
If you jump off the Grand Canyon you don't have thousands of traumatized spectators as a side effect of your actions.
"The Vessel either needs to be suicide proofed or closed to the public. We don't need a monument in the middle of the city with people raining down from it all the time. The connection between the Vessel and suicide has been established, you will see copycats."
"The Guggenheim has not, to my knowledge, had a single person take their own life. Even the artist has designed improved safety barriers that they said should be installed."
"I completely agree with you. You‚Äôre neither callous nor ill-informed. It shouldn‚Äôt be the responsibility of the rest of the world to put safety rails around everything. This is all private so they want to prevent the association with suicide for obvious reason, but the moral panic around it is so unreasonable."
"People who commit suicide are naturally drawn to certain places, usually famous or well known, to do it because they want their act to be a final grand gesture or cry for attention or whatever reason. THOSE are the places you suicide proof, or try to, or just make it more difficult. No one is advocating to try to suicide proof EVERY possible place where its a suicide can happen. That's your own strawman argument."
Do Niagara Falls or the Grand Canyon not meet those criteria? Or the Guggenheim?
Please stop giving them ideas.
"Unpopular opinion. But there should be legal medical suicide services. People do have a right to end their life, and if they want to end it they should be able to. It should be their right. And having places assisting in this could stop people from killing them selves in such dangerous ways or in front of others."
"Pretty sure the kinds of people who meticulously plan to end their lives for years and want to do so medically are in a different Venn diagram all together from people, like 14 year old boys, who make the decision in a matter of seconds and face no barriers to their rash decision. Many suicides are spur of the moment ideations that subside in a matter of minutes if they can't find a way to do it. It's really not hard as a society to make the means of offing oneself a little bit harder to attain. Like, for example, putting up a simple vertical barrier at an art installation that has already seen 3 suicides."
"You're not only being callous, you're being ill-informed."
You can educate without being insulting. OP was clearly not trying to be what you've accused them of anyway.
"It's NYC. There are about 1 billion easy to access places that you could jump off of and will almost certainly kill you, especially should you choose to take a dive. I guess taking a header off an overpass into the Cross-Bronx is less romantic or something, but you're still dead."
I think perhaps you should reconsider who is ill-informed here.
"Do you think that people visiting the Niagara Falls, or Prince Edward Viaduct in Canada wish to witness someone's demise during their visit?  Or perhaps a couple touring the Eiffel Tower? The beautiful Pigeon Rocks in Beirut?  The Gap in Australia?"
The Golden Gate Bridge or Hoover Dam?
Or how about the 12 story project in Detroit?  The George Washington Bridge?  The railroad behind the factory?  The carbon monoxide filled garage in anyone's home?
"I think you're confusing ""intrusive thoughts"" with ""suicidal behavior""."
"So what happens when the whole world is barricaded, but people still want to die?"
"Umm you do realize when someone jumps into Niagara Falls the water carries them away, but when someone jumps off the Vessel now you have a dead body just sitting there in the middle of the concrete of a major tourist attraction, right? There's quite a difference"
"can you think for a second about the people who went there to have a good time and witnessed a 14 year old DIE. this isn‚Äôt just about four peoples suicide among the millions of visitors, no one should have to see that"
I've never been there but isn't there a possibility jumpers could land on someone?
"Omg, amazing response. This was my exact thinking too, but I couldn't articulate it this well. Thanks for putting it together."
You sound like a monster
Somebody has to clean up the bloody pulp that results.
If they hit someone else they're going to kill them.
If you want to kill yourself that's your own choice. I don't agree with you but it is your own choice. But don't make other innocent people clean up your mess.
"And just looking at your post history, I'm unsurprised you have zero compassion. People with compassion don't share your political views. Especially your support for the Confederacy."
No wonder you have zero issues with people killing themselves.
Especially your support for the Confederacy.
My what now?
But don't make other innocent people clean up your mess.
How do I avoid this short of having my body fall into the ocean or a volcano? It seems like living in a metropolis is very cruel.
Agreed. they arent closing down the Golden Gate Bridge. But 4 people in 2 years is a ridiculously huge number. I think part of this is that A. its is a very high profile landmark and for whatever reason suicides a more prevalent at them and B. we are in dark times and this landmark opened right when they started.

"Honestly I agree, I‚Äôm sure people will think it‚Äôs shitty, but we shouldn‚Äôt alter things based around sad personal decisions. I think the solo visitor security approach and ample signage to dissuade and promote resources at the site is a good compromise."
If someone wants to build a monument that peopke can experience fun verticality than that should be allowed
Drugs should be legal.
Because we live in a society. /Seinfeld
"Honestly I think they should secure it not for the suicidees, but the people on the ground who could be injured/killed by a falling body and everyone else there who would have to witness it."
"Tell me, what do you land on when you jump into the Niagara falls? Now tell me what's below the vessel.. I'll give you a hint... People who didn't show up to die."
They fucked up the 2nd and 3rd and 4th time.
"After the first death, it's their fault. By the 4th death after almost 2 years of being told to put up vertical barriers, it feels criminal."
Sure you can. Do you think most building owners would just be cool and taken no efforts to change their building if they had 4 suicides in a year? Or you think they'd find that suicide is good for business and isn't a costly legal process after the fact?
Install the nets!
Yep.
"I mean, there is one directly across the street, and another 2 blocks away along the river."
that things looks beautiful wtf
"It's right off the High Line, which is a pretty famous and popular park."
"The vessel doesn't take up that much square footage, from what I recall. I don't know how big of a park they could have added."
"its surrounded by a large open public plaza and has a relatively small footprint, any park you put in the square foot space that the base of the vessel takes up would be pretty tiny, and its... also surrounded by a plaza and green strips. Statues, art installations and public spaces are good for the city, I mean I suppose they could knock down the statue of liberty and replace it with some trees and benches but I don't see how making moves like that actually help the city."
"It‚Äôs literally ought next door to one of the most expensive parks in the city, what do you have against the high line?"
"Demanding a park next to an existing incredibly high end park is, in a word, silly. You‚Äôre silly. If you want endless parks there‚Äôs plenty of open land upstate."
theres already one tho. its pretty central.
"It's part of a park. Good parks have interesting features, be they natural or man-made."
Old man yells at cloud
"I feel like the whole concept of that is to be Instagrammable. From any angle at any point of the day you get a nice picture, but having been there one time I don‚Äôt see any other reason to go back beyond taking pictures."
So what you're saying is that the installation created an experience for the public that allowed people to enjoy their surrounding environment from different angles and heights - enjoyable enough that they want to take a photograph to capture the moment? Sounds like a successful interactive public art installation to me. Aside from their extreme negligence in not adding vertical barriers early.
But but instagram bad
Right?! People say this as if we don't have boxes full of pictures our grandparents took of statues and monuments when they went in vacations 60+ years ago. The only difference is now people don't need to wait for photographs to be developed into slides so they can present them to friends and family.
"Yep and now with cell phones everyone has a camera, unlike back in our grandparents time. Of course everyone wants to take their own cool photos! Sure Instagram influencers are annoying, but they're a small minority of the user base"
"lol, when I'm traveling, I always seek out cool architecture and art exhibits, and if I was visiting NYC I would also add the vessel to my list. I think it accomplishes what it set out to do and that is to attract crowds to that area."
People just love to hate on anything these days.
well and the fact that it is a grotesque manifestation of the worst that architecture and private financed art has to offer the world. that said yes I climbed it and had myself a nice selfie.

"Sure, here‚Äôs one of many articles you can find about it. I agree it sounds pretty harsh."
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-12/the-visa-program-that-helped-pay-for-hudson-yards
"My problem, highly summarized, is this kind of development tells us who deserves high end architecture and who doesn‚Äôt. It reinforces our idea of what architecture is even supposed to do."
There are a million designers in NYC who could have done more with less.
You know what pictures just with your brain are called? Experiences.
"if we're building giant pieces of architecture solely for social media, we've truly lost our way as a society."
"Rich people and architects have been collaborating since the beginning of human history to build things that others will marvel at, want to capture in images, and just generally be associated with."
Let me know about any time in recorded human history where humans didn't create large scale art or monuments that were made for people to gather around and gawk at? Even the Soviets - the supposed bastions of utilitarianism - created large scale sculptures just for nationalist pride and visuals for the outside world. It's just now humans are.
"If you think this giant shawarma is comparable in visual appeal to the Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, or Worker and Kolkhoz Woman, you need your eyes checked"
"That's such a bad argument. Also, in which way is a naked steel tower beautiful in itself?"
"If you think that just because you don't like something everyone else mustn't either, you need your brain checked."
"Art is subjective. Yeah, the reviews of this one aren't kind. But it's not fundamentally in a different category."
"The Eiffel Tower was built as a dumb showpiece for a Worlds Fair. It's iconic, but you think that shit was pure art? Come on."
‚Ä¶.why? What would be the pinnacle of society if not enjoying the art produced by others?
"The pyramids exist because pharaohs wanted to build self-indulgent monuments to themselves. Same can be argued for picturesque castles and beautiful cathedrals, jockeying for influence and attention and power."
"What is the function of Rockefeller Center? I doubt you hate it. Do feel free to question the aesthetics, but do recognize society likes architectural greatness for its own sake."
Funny enough I said something similar to this after the third suicide and got downvoted a bunch. I honestly don‚Äôt know what people see in corporate art.
This . This right here. This.
Also it looks like a wastebasket.  Which in the context of an already dehumanizing built environment....
The whole thing was a bad idea.  Just pull it down already.
"It‚Äôs actually pretty cool looking, and people are gonna commit suicide anywhere there‚Äôs a way."
That‚Äôs just life I guess
a park would have been nice.
"I think it‚Äôs fine, people clearly like going there to take pictures and go with the family"
Make something idiot proof and someone will make a better idiot
That always reminds me of this fantastic scene in Parks & Rec
I wouldn‚Äôt call suicidal people idiots.
I didn't mean it like that. You took it literally. I just meant we can put all precautions and people will still somehow get more creative / destructive.
Looking at the photo this screams suicide. Maybe installing netting ever few floors would work
It‚Äôs gonna be uggo af with those and you can still just yeet yourself over. I called it years ago in the first announcement thread that this thing would become a suicide destination.
It probably cost too much
"How does the suicide rate at the Vessel compare to the rate at the Brooklyn Bridge, George Washington Bridge, Empire State Building, in front of subway trains, etc?"
"The Brooklyn Bridge and Empire State Building, at least, have significant barriers to jumping."
"21 from subway apparently, which isn‚Äôt that actually considering the size of the subway"
I‚Äôve read that many attempts in the subway do not result in death. It seems like potentially the most painful way to go.
"That's it, get rid of it all! /s"
Add the VZ Bridge to that list.  It's been a place for the last dozen or so years.
The real reason is that the vessel is ugly as sin
You just don't vibe with the aesthetic it holds.
"You could say that haha I prefer more green spaces, but it isn‚Äôt very popular with my arch friends either lol"
"I like some greenery and shrubbery as well, but nature is a chaotic and messy mistress. I'm kind of a fan of these big industrial spires that don't seem to have too much of a point to them. I remembered taking tons of pictures of power lines when I was young because of how imposing they are and how they just cut through the landscape."
"I think I would actually mix some shrubbery with the cityscape, on the other hand. Especially if it means building one of those eco-friendly building plans to suck up the excess CO¬≤ in the air and keeping what's left of our atmosphere from frying up."
"The more green, the better. Enough with the ugly sterile buildings. We need more trees!"
""
Power lines are fucking hideous and ruin pictures. People pay good money to live in neighborhoods where they‚Äôre underground. I‚Äôm surprised this is subjective.
"The whole highline is full of green space. Can't blame them for trying something different. I Dont love it either, but don't hate it."
Thank you
Then just demolish all of hudson yards
Ideas:
Hire a bunch of golden retrievers to run around trying to get visitors to play with them.
"Put a fun, foam pit beneath it."
"Bring on a design firm to go full MC Escher on it so when somebody thinks they're jumping, they're really just falling up"
"As visitors leave, they get a coupon for extra guac on their next Chipotle purchase."
This platform in general would have dominated the last mayoral race.
You had me at bunch of golden retrievers
"Bring on a design firm to go full MC Escher on it so when somebody thinks they're jumping, they're really just falling up"
now is not really the time to introduce musical guests at the vessel
What if we tether a minimum of 3 people together so you have to be willing to commit a double murder to kill yourself.
triple suicide pact.
Put a bird on it.
The first and last two would actually be practical and work well honestly. It‚Äôs sounds bullshit but even the small reward of leaving and getting free food would be enough to make people see some hope and reason to leave the spot. I‚Äôm sure some corporate food chain wouldn‚Äôt mind the good press
"This post is funny af, not gonna lie."
"or, you know, rip it down and build a fucking park like it should have been all along. Little Island is just a testament to how fucking worthless the vessel is and easily has the same draw for people trying to flex on IG."
Any new place with enough hype will draw big fucking crowds. I work near a spot that sells instagramable ice cream and it always has a line even though the ice cream itself is nothing special.
great point. all the more reason that shitty vessel should be a park.
"If it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking, it‚Äôs terrible ice cream"
Can you get wifi in this area? I think this place can make a pretty aesthetic hang out place if you have wifi. And plugs to charge your devices.
hauntingly brilliant
They should just put an IHOP at the top and put 10 foot glass barriers all around. Maybe instead of jumping someone will just have pancakes.
This is so poignantly spot-on it's poetic.
"Well, if Futurama has taught me anything, we'll be getting Suicide Booths in (New) New York City at some point."
This is the point where The Simpsons predictions end and Futurama takes the reigns I guess
TIL people don't get dark humor.
"Ironically, depressed people probably have the darkest sense of humor."
"Lots of horrible comments on this shit sub, but this one takes the cake."
Comment is hilarious lol
"Oh, come on. It was great, you humorless prig."

‚ÄúSlob‚Äù is inventive I suppose.

"Bruh please, there's more picturesque places to off yourself than Hudson Yards, with the added benefit of not traumatizing a thousand tourists."
Traumatizing the tourists is the whole point though.
I'm sellin' tickets to an Authentic 1929 Wall St experience.
"I'm not even kidding when I say that would be so fucking cool...as long as I get a ticket back too, not trying to stick around once I get hungry."

No

"I can imagine a scenario where the original architect is blamed for not wanting to compromise the artistic vision or whatever. Seems like they're explicitly clarifying that is not the case, without totally throwing the developer under the bus (just yet, I guess) by using an off the record quote."
Can't imagine that there will be anything but more heat on the developer now.
That sucks. I really wanted to see it.
Then need to just put up a bunch of plexiglass to stop people's access from jumping.
"Forget the shawarma looking thing go see the high line right next to. As a local, this is the only tourist attraction that I recommend to people. It's a nice walk on an all railroad track elevated above the hustle and bustle of the streets. Where one can peer into architectural wonders."
I‚Äôve never heard it described as resembling shawarma but that‚Äôs hilarious

Yeah I either think of it as Roti/Shawarma or a Pinecone lol

I like it. It's kind of like a real life MC Escher. Plus I really wanted to Rocky my way to the top punching and yelling Adrian Adrian!
Im a local and i enjoyed climbing the vessel. Its just a cool looking thing
"Now that you have called it a shwarma, that is all I see.  I am stealing it."
It‚Äôs nice until you run into people taking pictures every few feet and blocking the path.
It looks like a bee hive to me.
"I wanted to check it out too, but then they banned single people from going... after the last suicide."
Suicide pacts only.
I had the exact same feeling! I‚Äôm also scared of heights and the railings are so surprisingly low? I made it to the top to look around but the whole time I was so nervous! I felt like I could fall over üò≠
"IMO going inside is kind of dumb. The Vessel looks amazing from the outside. Going inside of the Vesel, where you can't actually see the Vessel, kind of defeats the purpose. If you haven't seen the Vessel you should totally go, it's amazing. I live in Hudson Yards and I have no desire to climb to the top of the Vessel. Looking at it from the outside is honestly better"
yeah but that would ruin the instagram photos that people go there for
"You can still see it.  You just won't have the 'privilege' of paying to walk up/down it.  It's an interesting sculpture, but there are better views elsewhere."
It‚Äôs free to go up it.
That sucks. I really wanted to see it.
It opened in 2019. Have you been busy?
Yeah actually.
"Or just redesign the thing and enclose it in glass. Plexiglass would look like garbage after a short time, especially outside"
"I can understand closing it because there's a risk a jumper will land on someone. Then again, this has happened many times from buildings."
Which are now required to have limited window openings and guardrails or plexiglass barriers
Or chain link fences if roof access is permitted.
"Maybe instead of raising the barriers to 11ft, they could put a safety net at the base to catch people who fall / jump off."
"Until the kids as ""Daddy, what's that net for?"""
The Bobst library at NYU has a design like this. Terrifying for someone who has vertigo like myself.
"Before they put up the barriers, NYU also suffered from a ""high drop out rate""."
"True, I was an undergrad there in 2009, when the 3rd suicide happened. They have installed barriers but it took quite awhile to do."
I'm more concerned about the safety of bystanders near the structure. It can happen anywhere where there's high elevation anyway so why not just put up measures to minimize the risk for the majority? Just set up a perimeter around the Vessel where foot traffic is prohibited.
Isn‚Äôt it the same for any tall building? I live in Chicago so perhaps NYC is different‚Ä¶ but I can hop off my balcony from the 11th floor to the 4th floor amenity deck. I could go the 18th floor and hop off the other amenity deck down to ground level. Most buildings I‚Äôve seen have balconies facing the sidewalk.
"Yep. Apartment balconies, shopping malls, cellphone towers, subway tracks, Queens Blvd, Long Island expressway, Brooklyn Bridge, the Hudson River...plenty of places for people to off themselves of they're determined to do so. At some point we have to realize we cant shut everything down due to the potential for these types of incidents."
Just rename ‚ÄúThe Urn‚Äù and it‚Äôs back in business
"""The vessel"" wasn't even its official name AFAIK."
Instead of simply preventing the act we should be improving mental health services and the accessibility of these services. Or creating a society that people don‚Äôt need to kill themselves to escape.
He was from New Jersey
Couldn't agree more. But until that happens these measures are necessary.
Another option would be to deal with the causes of the suicides. But that would require politicians to do things their oligarch bosses do not approve of. Pity.
He had to be close enough that one of his family members could of stopped him. So tragic
Could have been worse if he took someone with him.
why even comment something like this
Certainly a jumper sometimes unintentionally takes a hero trying to save them down. It would be a shame if it was family.
"okay i understand what you meant, thank you"
requiring visitors to enter with at least one companion and changing the free admission policy to $10 per ticket were the new safety measures that were applied in may after the reopening.
"That was their brilliant idea to curb suicides? If someone wants to take their own life, paying $10 and a pal isn't going to stop them."
Most suicides are indeed in solitude
You'd be surprised.
"I think the $10 thing is stupid but I could definitely imagine killing yourself in front of someone you know would be a lot harder than doing it alone. Even tho you might want it to end, you still care about other people and don't want to subject them to watching you die."
In the case of the Vessel its def not enough tho
The $10 probably isn't enough of a deterrent but having someone with you at all times is a semi-decent way to prevent people from jumping.
That's ridiculous. It's not the building that causes suicides.
It is the building that allows them to do it so publicly and leaves lasting emotional scars on people who see it though.
Do you feel the same way about subway suicides? Do you believe the subway system should be shut down?
Tons of people have made a public spectacle of their suicide by throwing themselves on the train tracks. Most of us don't even bat an eye at that anymore.
School and the subway provide irreplaceable services. It's a bit different.
People kill themselves all over the city. I'm sorry but 4 suicides shouldn't cause a monument to be shut down. No amount of suicides should influence public policy in that way. It's treating a symptom and not the sickness.
The vessel isn't a monument.  And I agree about mental health being the real issue here. But that just isn't being fixed.
This was a 200 million dollar investment to create a new structure of cultural/aesthetic significance for the city. We're valuing 50 million dollars + per suicide.
I'm sorry but I don't think we should be so conservative that the idea of 4 suicides should cause a permanent shut down.
Cutting your losses with something isn't being conservative. If they didn't close it there will be more than 4 suicides. They also aren't tearing it down.
"It was designed as something people would look from and explore within. Even if you don't tear it down, shuttering the inside destroys its aesthetic purpose. It's unnecessary and reactionary. You don't know how many suicides there will be and furthermore you don't know how many suicides would actually be prevented by shutting it down. This kid could've easily thrown himself in front of a train on the way there."
Ever hear of suicide copycats? When one kid kills themself at a school others follow suit. Its a phenomena / curse that very well may have been gaining traction at the Vessel due to the age and proximity of those who died.
""
"so funny you say that, I was also thinking how this thing is like an SCP come to life"
I think it‚Äôs very sad what‚Äôs happened but it will continue to happen without some drastic change. I look forward to revisiting this area and I‚Äôd accept it without or severe design changes.
8-foot panels of plexiglass will fix this. They can afford it.
"I remember something like this at Carnegie Mellon, called Architect's leap. It was a stairwell with a death poem written on the way down to the bottom where there was a body outlined in chalk. Pretty gruesome stuff, eventually they painted over it."
"And with one ingenious stroke, the city made it impossible for anyone to find a tall structure from which to jump to their death."
Good
Turn it onto it‚Äôs side and roll that piece of trash into the Hudson
Let's all clean up our streets by dumping all the trash into the river.  You're a genius.

"Suicide is more an impulsive act brought on by an acute crisis, than  it is a chronic condition.  Hence why the main premise of suicide prevention is creating seemingly small impediments to completing the act or timely intervention.  Vast majority of people that survive an initial attempt suicide don't go on to take their own life.  Hence why having a gun in your home is linked to higher suicide rate, not just higher gun suicide rate."
"That's nonsense. People just refuse to do anything to treat chronic causes. Like not having lives worth living due to economic and social conditions. The reason the crux of ""suicide prevention"" is tiny inconveniences is because nobody can be arsed to give young people jobs, or make having a family possible again. Suicide rates continue to increase."
"Nine out of ten people who attempt suicide and survive will not go on to die by suicide at a later date. This has been well-established in the suicidology literature. A literature review (Owens 2002) summarized 90 studies that have followed over time people who have made suicide attempts that resulted in medical care. Approximately 7% (range: 5-11%) of attempters eventually died by suicide, approximately 23% reattempted nonfatally, and 70% had no further attempts."
"Even studies that focused on medically serious attempts‚Äìsuch as people who jumped in front of a train (O‚ÄôDonnell 1994)‚Äìand studies that followed attempters for many decades found similarly low suicide completion rates. At least one study, published after the 90-study review, found a slightly higher completion rate. This was a 37-year follow-up of self-poisoners in Finland that found an eventual completion rate of 13% (Suominen 2004)."
"This relatively good long-term survival rate is consistent with the observation that suicidal crises are often short-lived, even if there may be underylying, more chronic risk factors present that give rise to these crises."

"Only four people have survived a suicide jump from the Golden Gate Bridge. One would hit the water at well over 120mph leaving one almost incapable of handling the freezing waters. All four were left seriously injured for life, regretted doing it and never tried again."
Made of this what you will.
Can you outline for me how you would like to run a control study on suicide?  Thanks.
"How would that establish causation, not correlation?"

Because you literally ask suicidal people why they're suicidal instead of talking over them

Keep shifting those goal posts‚Ä¶
"The fact that, even though you're right, people are still drawn to doing it on attractions like the Vessel says a lot."

Scientifically that‚Äôs not true.
Sure...and we made sure they have one less public place to do it and traumatize everyone in the vicinity.
And they thought lower income people would be the issue...
Its also already falling apart this was a vanity project that wasted tax dollars. The sheer amount of community projects that get rejected for being an 8th of what this mess cost is ridiculous. The whole thing just needs to come down so we can build something useful and aesthetic like a fucking park.
Do you have any source for it being funded by tax payer money? Looks like it was privately funded.

Maybe we try to build a better society where the people who produce the wealth don't have such shitty lives that the majority wish for death as an escape from exploitation.
"Check his or her profile. No fewer than a dozen comments today, all of which are arguing or complaining. Hit the nail on the head."
"I'm 41, I'm sorry you think that caring about working people is for stupid children.  Hope neoliberalism holds out for you and you get to enjoy your unearned privileges until the ecosystem collapses."
Seems easier to install barriers than changing all of society to eradicate depression and suicide
Its like why they still put ashtrays on airplanes
"Maybe that's their long game. They put bigger price tags on the admissions, and it goes to funding better security. And if that alienates people from attending, they use it as an opportunity to shut it all down."
"Actually it's those who don't produce wealth who create and maintain the system of exploitation that immiserates those who do.  Just like a planter sipping a mint julep and ordering the overseer to whip the slaves, the financier and landlord step over the mangled corpses of the jumpers with nary a care but the mess on their gucci loafers."
"Vessel is a horror show on every level. Ugly as fuck, conceptually depressing, a monument to pernicious extreme wealth, a theft of value from the people of New York, and a driver of suicide."
Tear this down.
What was there before it?  A public area even with a dumb publicly accessible monument is the definition of creation of value.
It's not really a 'public area' when the Vessel and surrounding area is patrolled by security that make you feel unwelcome and always watched.
If you even attempt to sit you'll be accosted to move.
"What do OP and that site have against capital letters? Fuck, that was hard to read."

"Having said that. I find it ridiculous that an attraction should be closed just because it's a spot for suicides.  Like, why ruin it for everyone else?"
There are lots of tall places. Is there something that draws people who want to jump to go here?
It‚Äôs creepy right. Suicide vortex. Gross.
"I think its the iconic look of the structure along with the ease, suicide from landmarks can become romanticized."
Why??? I wanna smash my skull into a million pieces!!!
"This is gonna sound really callous, but putting nets or barriers will mar the aesthetics, and be too expensive. Why not just have better mental health services?"
I mean it boils down to people not voting for politicians who actually want people to be able to have access to things.
""
This is almost as bad as the suicide during the morning rush. Why ruin it for the living?
Fuck this ugly ass suicide gyro. TEAR IT DOWN
I‚Äôm sorry but to what extent does the building carry blame if someone wants to kill themselves? They‚Äôre gonna find a way.
"That's not really true. A lot of suicide attempts by teenagers/young adults are actually impulsive decisions. That is, they see the opportunity and take it. They don't climb the structure or enter into a circumstance seeking their death. We know this as many people who attempt but survive suicide almost always do not try again."
"I think the first suicide was forgivable, but the designers of the Vessel have wanted to implement safety features for a while. By the fourth time it's basically the developer's fault for not adjusting the design, IMO."
"If you jump off a building, you wanna die. There‚Äôs not take backs jumping from a building onto concrete."
"People survive overdoses and jumping off bridges into water, but how many cases are there of people surviving concrete? Obviously they have some issues but why should a building close and people lose their jobs over 4 people killing themselves?"
Can't speak to your last question but just FYI this is not at all how suicide actually works.

Because of the legal liability issues when number 5 jumps. Even the worst lawyer in NYC is going to have fun when they claim (again) they didn't know this was going to happen (again).
He could had easily done it on the subway if that were the case
Why do a few mentally ill people get to ruin something for millions of others? Hey that's the story of NYC right now though.
The vessel to the afterlife.  Unfortunately and sad
Maybe they can fully dismantle it then re-assemble it upside down? That way it tapers to a point instead of flaring out at the top. In this configuration each level is smaller than the one it‚Äôs above and anyone leaping off falls one flight only.  The area at street level inside the cone will need a bit of thought though.....
That makes no sense...
"I think he means instead of it making a V shape, have it make a ^ shape. Like jumping from the top of a pyramid, you're only going to hit the next step in the pyramid, and not the ground far below."
Yah but then they gotta seal up the inside facing parts of the walkway because now the inside is the danger side with the clear straight drop from every level.
I imagine people will jump somewhere else...
"You‚Äôd think so, but study of suicide has found it to be largely opportunistic. The smallest barriers  have been found to drastically reduce the incidence of suicide. Turns out when you take away the convenience most people reconsider."
This played out in one famous case where suicide-barriers installed on a particular bridge reduced the overall suicide rate of a small town like 400%.
And this is why I‚Äôll never let myself own a handgun‚Ä¶.
"Ow that article hurt my brain, the website doesn't believe in using capital letters"
"there are plenty of places to jump in NYC, why choose the one place with a crowd of people directly below?"

I really hope the barriers don't kill the experience
"People don't really crowd around the Vessel on a normal day. It's a cleaner fall than you could expect from any street-facing building. Also, the 2 or more rule was already in place."

"Replace it with living green space including trees and other plants, not mostly stone with a few trees."
Then do the same with the rest of Hudson Yards and a lot more of the city.
This was always a bad idea. The whole redevelopment of this area has been a disastrous piece of the Bloomberg legacy.
"Ah yes, I'll always miss that open air train yard"
Yeah wtf. It‚Äôs gone great.
Even for poors like me it's a free clean bathroom to use after walking the high line.
And the new station funded as part of the development made getting my shot at Jabbits way easier.
That new station is fantastic.
You mean the end station of the 7 line that leaks water from the ceiling?
I haven't run into the water leaking at that station.  Certainly it seems more water tight than a lot of the other stations in the system.
"But having a solid connector to the largest convention center in the city is awesome!  Or, for that matter, good access to the west side in general."

Affordable housing for seniors. Currently NYCHA has a disproportionate amount of seniors living there by themselves but occupying 3 bedroom and larger apartments. Get them a nice spot to live somewhere in a one bedroom and you open up 3 bedrooms + for young families.
That's a fuck lot of money to build an entire steel platform to house senior affordable housing on top of some vibrating rail road tracks.
"Even if we aren't a capitalist society, it makes zero sense because senior folks don't need quick access to municipal trains and it's not wise to house them in super tall buildings that are hard to access by medics in cases of emergencies."
"Well meaning ideologies do not equate good ideas sometimes. Build the senior homes closer to countryside with clean air and lower housing density, integrated with essentials and clinic facilities, like that great dementia village experiment thing in the Netherlands."
"Except seniors and retirees are the main demographic for Broadway, and living in an area where they didn't have to commute but had good access to trains would be essential to helping them get around a city like New York. I mean there's other populations you could house here, but mixed used residential makes a hell of a lot more sense than this gigantic statue that really serves no value other than as a viral suicide spot."
Depends on what kind of seniors who are rich enough to go see Broadway every day. Those seniors don't need your affordable housing and are perfectly fine living in their three bedroom apartments on Park Ave. Hudson Yards is too far away from Broadway anyway.
""
"I do realize that, but they are 421a abated if I'm not mistaken, which is really not a solid affordable housing program."
Broadway has tickets that seniors on fixed incomes could afford who would live in these places.
"Again, there are other uses of the space, but undeniably if they are ALREADY considering closing it, the Vessel was a GIANT waste of money and resources."

"Could mix it with more expensive housing to attract developers, and still do retail on the ground floors either way. The air rights there are fit for multiuse and housing seems to be a more pressing need than more office space."
Could mix it with more expensive housing to attract developers
"what developers are ""attracted"" to mostly immobile people with fixed incomes?"
People who want the tax break to build affordable so they could also build luxury housing? It's how the city structured 421a.
its used for office and retail. like it is.
"yes, something that generates the most revenue to the city. And then the city can use this money for affordable housing"
and where would they put this affordable housing?  seniors especially need the easy accessibility.
how about midtown manhattan?
"The argument against the stadium, and why it was defeated, is that the land was far more useful as affordable housing. Watching what Hudson Yards became, I honestly don't believe the stadium was a worse option."
"I think more housing of any kind is better than a stadium, but that's just me"
"and yet it didn‚Äôt in all those years, looks like that was the winning project"
Winning bid*
"I mean it needs to be profitable to be viable, or else why would anyone build at all"
"We have office, residential, commercial, and public space. Seems like a net win to me"
this but unironically
"Come to Queens to get your fix, Sunnyside Yards is still here and completely exposed for the foreseeable future"
can't tell if you didn't see my flair or its a dig at Ridgewood haha
"Oh haha I missed your flair. ""Come to Queens"" is pretty much a reflexive phrase cause this is usually such a Brooklyn/Manhattan focused sub"
Coulda used the money for housing or a million better things than the suicide statue
?
"Agreed, although an empty soulless luxury development that cost billions only to be shunned by the rich and used by the tourists and the desperate is a great encapsulation of present day NYC. I know this would never have happened considering how much that land is worth, but a park would have been so great to see in that space. A real park, not a packed artist installation like the high line or the little island."
it seems like they deliberately avoided putting a park there because parks are for everyone but luxury is for the few.
The Vessel used to be free...
The high line is free....
Tear it down.
Good it‚Äôs a disgusting pimple of a thing that represents the corporate takeover of Manhattan
OH snaPp it‚Äôs really happening.
Welcome to 21st century problem solving. The time for sensible solutions has passed.
"It's not unlike how we're exploring the decision to shut down the entire economy (again) in spite of our vaccination numbers and low breathrough rates. It's why the news reports new cases in percentages now instead of the actual numbers. ""45% new cases"" sounds better."
""
The suicide numbers on other methods? Let's not talk about those.
The problem with the virus is the longer it‚Äôs active and has hosts available for spreading the more likely it becomes a variant evolves that is vaccine resistant.
"Delta is highly infectious, but is less likely to cause breakthrough cases in vaccinated individuals. The next variant may be as infectious but more dangerous to the vaccinated."
"There‚Äôs also the issue where some cannot be vaccinated, such as my two year old son."
The decision to shut down should not come lightly but may be necessary to finally beat this thing once and for all. We had it on the ropes until Delta emerged. Those who remain unvaccinated put us all at risk now and in the future.
"I do not think there is a conspiracy. I do believe that the Delta is worse than the first, but I also did not think that the first was as bad as most people made it seem. I don't think it's a joke, but people are going to continue to discredit the seriousness of the pandemic if people keep politicizing it and also doing things that genuinely do not make sense."
"For example, if we see another George Floyd-like incident, will WHO declare racism to be the real public health issue again? Those statements did a lot of damage to people's credibility."
Obamacare booo!!!! üëªüëªüëªüò±üò±üò±
Closing would be such a massive waste of resources since it's already built. At least try new barriers maybe? Though I wouldn't be surprised if HY leadership and developers is just like nah fuck this bad press lol.
"Or just stop the charades of lock downs, schools being closed & now vaccine passports and I‚Äôm sure less ppl will want to kill themselves ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
What a giant waste of money
Does anyone care? They should tear the ugly fucking thing down.
I said this thing was stupid and poor designed from day one and it was going to attract jumpers. Tear this eyesore down‚Ä¶.
tear it down
Stupid shit!
The whole building is basically screaming SUICIDE NOW!
"Humans can not be trusted, they are flawed! There should not have been a possibility to commit FINAL EXIT!"
Sad to say but I knew it was gonna happen. Nice attraction but this place is almost haunted this point. RIP to those who lost their life.
I'm dying to go there.
Just tear it apart at the developers cost. No one gives a shit about it.
"Good, its dumb as fuck."
Honest question - how are higher barriers going to prevent people from jumping? If you're really motivated you're going to get over a wall.
Not if the wall is plexiglass covering the entire or most of the opening on each level. The top level can have a barrier as tall as Top of the Rock's.
"Got it.. I'm also seeing a lot of other information here indicating that even small deterrents could keep somebody from jumping, since many of these decisions are impulsive. Complicated issue - plexiglass covering all of the openings will obviously be very expensive to add, and will also remove a lot of the drama that the piece has as you're walking through it. As others have also pointed out, there are also thousands of other buildings to jump off of in the city if you really want to. What makes this thing different outside of it being an attraction?"
"Having said that, I do understand the issue here. I sadly had somebody jump to their death in front of me on 22nd street a few years ago. They landed literally across the street from me, and I was the first to go to check on them and call the police. Not only will I not forget the sound the person made when they hit the concrete (Sounded like a gunshot - I literally have nightmares about this sometimes), but I also had incredible anxiety walking down this street for months after. I even adjusted my route to work because of this, for quite some time. I'd also find myself compulsively staring up at rooftops randomly. This is coming from somebody who is very level headed, has a great support system, and typically doesn't have any mental issues. All this to say..."
"Complicated issue. The piece obviously attracts people and is open to the public, and therefore is a target for jumpers. NYC also has subway tracks that people jump on, buildings that people jump out of, etc... Not sure you're really going to stop somebody who really wants to end their life by putting plexiglass on this thing."
This is absolutely crazy one of New York City‚Äôs newest landmarks has become a suicide point in the city of New York.
"As someone who was around during the construction, I never knew the significance of it.  I must've waked those stairs a hundred times while it was being built and thought it was completely useless...  I was building the mall, and my buddies were in the Vessel."
"We all knew that thing was a bad idea, but goddamn I didn't think it'd be a Premier spot for suicides."
"Nicely designed suicide nets, like in China, really a no brainer solution. If done right, they can also improve the aesthetics."
Awful design...
it should never have been opened or created tbh.
Further emphasizing its waste of money.
"cant just shut down tall buildings/attractions.. it maybe ugly, but aint its fault..."
Tear down the trash can
They should tear the thing down! It is now a very sad place.
"A sculpture built with private money on private land as an originally free attraction to the city. I have no sympathy for people who kill themselves in such an aggressive fashion as to ruin it for everybody else. Fuck those people, they are the reason we can‚Äôt have nice things."
Another waste of money
There‚Äôs an entire chapter in ‚Äútalking to strangers‚Äù that‚Äôs says this is actually very false. An example was how high suicide rates were when ovens had high carbon monoxide levels. Besides It‚Äôs not that great of an attraction. I know several people that work in Hudson Yards and not one has walked up the thing. I‚Äôm sure if you walked by a dead splattered body on pavement on your way to work you‚Äôd feel differently.
"Speaking as someone who works in a building with two curtain walls facing the Vessel, this is not something a thousand people minding their own business should ever be forced to see."
What a waste of money.
"If true, good. It's an eyesore."
thank god it‚Äôs so ugly
People can take their life in a variety of ways. The root issue is that they want to take their life not the way they do it.
Then why not address that issue?
"Why are most commenters celebrating the potential permanent closing of a structure that has been praised around the globe for its design? It has been enjoyed by tens of thousands of people, but due to 4 people that have had mental issues the rest of us must not enjoy the structure?"
How do other cultures deal with this issue? I've been in many countries that don't design their public spaces to prevent people from taking their lives. The uproar over just 4 lives and not mass shootings or mass suicides by guns is puzzling. I understand keepthestoke's dilema?
The uproar over just 4 lives and not mass shootings or mass suicides by guns is puzzling.
"There's been plenty of uproar about mass shootings. In this case, one issue plainly is easier to solve."
"I don't think architecturally it is beautiful, but even it were, that would have to be weighed against its attraction to suicidal people. The developer appears resistant to making it safer by adding barriers."
So removing an obvious and public means is a bad idea?
Let's leave loaded shotguns in the same room as suicidal people while we research the causes of suicide.;
Because people mostly kill themselves with guns in the privacy of their own homes. If they kept going to one particular structure to shoot themselves we would have measures to stop that too.
"So what‚Äôs the solution? Ban all hand guns? That won‚Äôt fix the issue. Suicidal people are still going to be suicidal, and can either go out of their way to get an illegal gun or can just find another method."
""
Strict firearm laws reduce gun deaths: here‚Äôs the evidence
""
Australia marks 25 years since worst mass shooting
Honestly the facade of ThE vEsSeL is probably a contributing factor. Away with this monstrosity.
So close all the bridges in the world
Sell this crap to Saudi Arabia.
i wonder if they're looking at a lawsuit from the 4th jumpers family
Good. The building is haunted now.
"got downvoted for suggesting that the building is contaminated with evil, glad that the adults in charge are being sensible and doing what needs to be done."
Dam ü¶´
but then how will i know if i should go out with someone from tinder?
Rails?
"We could always use a little more green spaces, but this would be such a tiny park if The Vessel was demolished. You could cram maybe one full basketball court into the space."
Maybe they should ban social media also? I wonder what has caused or been responsible for more suicides the vessel or social media.
that copy design on the website really bothers me. using periods and then the first letter is lowercase is certainly a choice.
Really? WTF.
Good
What is the purpose of that monstrosity?
Damn I never even got to visit yet.
They should have put up barriers like they were asked to
Well now they have to dedicate it to them and it‚Äôs a memorial.
Brooklyn Bridge has entered the chat room‚Ä¶..
I'm suprised it's only 4 with how long it's been open.
So sad. =[ especially for the fam witnessing it all. Sigh
I love the vessel keep it open
Not fair
Sounds like a crazy World‚Ä¶ we need Jesus
Does anyone actually think the vessel is cool
