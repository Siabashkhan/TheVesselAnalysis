The Shwarma of Death.
This is the funniest thing I‚Äôve read all day
not my joke and I don't remember where I first read it.
Still glad you shared!
I'm partial to Suischwarma
Isn‚Äôt this shit closed? I thought too many people were attempting to clock out of life on this thing.
"Yes, the suicide machine is now merely a convoluted obelisk, an empty vessel if you will."
The should just rip it down then.  Waste of space.
And it‚Äôs ugly as hell
As is all of Hudson yards
"I have to say, though, the tourists seem to love it.  Whenever I go there it‚Äôs pretty packed. Even the mall, which was deserted for so long, is pretty busy."
I mean yea it's all vanity no real substance
"Phase 2 will be mostly residential, so that's good."
Residential for the billionaire who could afford an apartment there for the 6 weeks a year they spend in New York
I‚Äôd rather they buy it there than in a neighborhood where people actually live and like
Good point.
Usually the lower floors are pretty affordable less than 500k sometimes even 250. These would also have dedicated affordable units. We do need to build more housing. Whether or not you actually like the people who will live there. Better rich people in there than taking up housing other people need. We can't make new old buildings.
Maybe. They‚Äôre floating plans for a casino there now instead.
Seriously doubt most of current Nyc will afford any of that
You are quite gullible.
Always was
"You can go in the bottom, but not up the stairs."
Can they not just put higher glass on this? I don‚Äôt get why it‚Äôs still closed
Oh boo hoo. Maybe they should have designed something that doesnt make people want to throw themselves off it.
MaYbE ThE ArTiSt ShOuLd HaVe MaDe iT sHoRtEr
The Plate
The Vase
That‚Äôs like saying whoever designed the World Trade Center shouldn‚Äôt have built a building that made people want to fly planes into it.
You‚Äôre being absurd.
"Then also implemented a ""can't go by yourself"" policy, since you're less likely to commit suicide if you're with someone you know (friend, significant other, family member, etc.) and aside from their presence, maybe they can physically stop you or help you."
Some states have the same policy for their gun ranges.
"Anyway, a teenager jumped off/committed suicide in front of his family when he went up there with them and that was the last straw that broke the camel's back"
Higher glass would make it even more boring. Tear it down. It‚Äôs an evil eyesore and a waste of space.
"Yep, it's only there so that Hudson Yards could qualify for tax write offs. We live in a capitalist wasteland."
"You think it‚Äôs bad now, wait for the post-capitalist wasteland."
"Good lord, no matter what the thread is someone will be in the comments bitching about capitalism."
"Gee, I wonder why üòÇ"
the irony of it all being done on a brand new phone or computer is what gets me
"I don't think it is an eyesore.  and it doesn't take up much space, really."
But you concede it‚Äôs evil.
Designed by the Devil himself.
I‚Äôve always thought it looked pretty neat. Regardless of the cost and the eventual suicides and stuff. I find it very odd looking in an exciting way. Idk I enjoy it
the Suicide Pineapple
The acorn
"""You ever wanna walk up a fuck ton of stairs to go nowhere? We got you, bro."""
I feel for the artist that got suckered into this vanity project...but it has gotta go. Hudson Yards is a symbol of the mediocrity of the wealthy. A fuckin upper class mall and a death spiral at the end of the best public works project the city has made in years.
"It's a complete shit mall, combined with a complete shit overpriced food court"
What public works projects?
I‚Äôm assuming they‚Äôre refering to The Highline. Hudson Yards does make a real bummer end point.
"The extension to the Manhattan West plaza across from Moynihan Train Hall/James Farley Post Office is a more fitting end point imo. Should be opening in early 2023, if it keeps on its current pace."
"Like said previously, The Highline. A total reuse of an existing feature to turn it into an extention of public land. It has a focus on greenscape and the overall showcase of architecture on and around it is really cool."
It just leads into one of the most grotesque uses of money in the history of New York...Hudson Yards. Am I on board with using the space above the tracks? Sure. As long as the workers aren't fucked over for it because it is now covered.
"However...the glass monoliths just like a glass scar on a city with much more depth and diversity and gaudy attempts at ""chic""? yuck...it's beyond soulless. The whole area is just everything wrong with modern spending by the wealthy who are so deeply up their own asses. It's a stain on the city landscape, imo. The fact they took that whole lot and turned into a ""fancy"" mall is the EPITOME of not reading the room. Malls are dieing, left and right, and they had the audacity to create a multi-billion dollar one at the end of a great park? Fuck that. Hudson Yards has a few local chains but overall is entirely banks and tech money and high priced wealthy only stores."
Suicide Stairs
Must be haunted by now
I love it. It‚Äôs a piece of art in the city. It‚Äôs unique and well fit the area. Regardless all shit that happened after opening
RIP you piece of art.
"This is the most disappointing part of walking the high line northwards. Finish and see that, or the heartless retail shops to the right."
I mean you get an amazing view left of the vessel once you‚Äôre out of the high line but okay
Ask the Mortician did s great episode on this not too long ago (titled ‚ÄúIs this $250 million selfie spot dangerous?‚Äù):
https://youtu.be/Bw3256SkN0k
"ETA: not that anyone asked me but yeah, it‚Äôs a stupid looking and dangerous vanity project that should be scraped."
"It‚Äôs like a shopping mall nightmare. I wish this hadn‚Äôt been constructed. Profoundly stupid, ugly, useless and offensive."
Of course it‚Äôs legacy will be an association with suicide. Looking at it makes me wonder what the value of life is too.
Let‚Äôs me guess instead you want a place where homeless can inject themselves ‚Ä¶..
You think the homeless don‚Äôt shoot up around there?
I think this is truly the dumbest building in NYC
Why were there so many jumpers?  Aren‚Äôt there bridges and high buildings?
Most tall buildings aren‚Äôt open to the general public. Those that are have safety devices in place which discourage the self-checkout.
Most bridges also have such devices in place.
The Wessel did not.
""
"My understanding is that the artist and the landlord are currently in disagreement, it‚Äôs the artist who is pushing back on changes that would improve safety."
"Bridges are also important and useful, and if you closed the GWB or Brooklyn Bridge, even partially, there would be a political firestorm."
"For the bridges, you'd only have to close it to pedestrians, though."
It‚Äôs also very empty and depressing itself
Plenty easy to jump of the Queensboro or Triboro if one desired
Didn‚Äôt some kid kill himself by jumping off that?
several did
And then made it so you couldn‚Äôt go alone and a son jumped while with his family.
yep. I think that was the last one.
More to come.
""
Tear it down.
been a while since i've seen a decent pic of this - nice one.
Is it still closed?  Wife wants to go there so badly.
"Yes, still closed."
She can get an even better view from the GWB. Probably more air too..
It wasn‚Äôt that great. Kind of neat but ultimately you just end up with a view of the buildings surrounding it.
"If you want a view, go to the Edge."
It‚Äôs ‚Äúart‚Äù. üôÑ
Just a disgusting building
Tear it down and build a homeless shelter or public mental health hospital there
"Ah yes more homeles people wandering around making a clean area dirty. The place is already kind a ghost town, with a homeless shelter no one would go there at all."
Ahh yes because the main camp near Timesquare scares the tourists off
No one who lives in nyc goes to TimeSquare regularly. Only tourists who DON‚ÄôT  know any better go there.
"Port Authority, NYT, many large apartments, and several large businesses are by there. I have to walk through the crowds of people there every week. I have a coworker who lives on 43rd. You must not frequent that area"
Also Hudson Yards and the High Line were made in mind for tourists
Hudson yards being a ghost town is a great reason to give some of the 80k homeless in New York a house and an opportunity. You just want them on the street or do you want to help them get better? You can‚Äôt throw them all off the vessel
Give the homeless a house ?!?!? People can‚Äôt even afford one while working but a useless junkie who‚Äôs doing drugs all day while pissing himself deserves one ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
lol sure drugs and needles are way better than 4 suicides in 2 years in a city of 8 millions ‚Ä¶. Youre pathetic
It looks pretty cool from the equinox pool
I‚Äôll get you a guest pass if you want
Yes.
where is this? I wanna get lost in here
"It's not built like that to get lost in. It's called The Vessel, and it's like an art building that's just a repeating pattern of pointless staircases in a circle."
"Lots of people hate it, calling it a waste of space."
It's currently closed because people keep jumping off of the top floor.
Its currently closed
"20 Hudson Yards, New York, NY 1000."
Shut it down
r/urbanhell
It‚Äôs closed mate
I saw for the first time last weekend when I drove around Manhattan
Is it open again? Last time I was in NYC it was closed because someone jumped off it.
It's open again? Or this is an old shot?
"Old shot , 3 months ago."
I didn't even know they were back open 3 months ago.
Not anymore.
Is it ever open anymore?
Did they finally reopen it?
"Edit: it would appear that it is not open. For anyone not from NY, it has been closed for I-can‚Äôt-remember-how-long due to numerous suicides. It seems they are unable to put up barricades (similar to top of the rock) because the artist does not want them. So, it remains closed."
"It is still pretty cool to see; however, one of my favorite things to do in NY is start at the bottom of the Highline and work my way up to the Vessel."
r/evilbuildings
"You mean ""The suicide""? The rising ""Contraption of Terror""! The ""Follow your eyes........over the edge""!! The worse example (or one of the worst)of a Bloomberg era waste of taxpayer funds!"
This is an incredibly thought-provoking article to read if you have the time.
