"Chicago has a giant metal bean, now New York has a giant metal pine cone"
""
Otherwise known as the big Shwarma.
How the fuck did that get built?
"I really like it, but am ridiculously surprised it got approval."
Would be nice with mini gardens/grass on each level though.
"Supposedly the developer paid for it out of pocket because he liked the idea so much and thought the area needed a ""magnet"" to draw people over to the neighborhood."
It definitely worked. Hudson Yards wouldn't see a fraction of the visitors it does without Vessel
The pine cone is a publicity stunt for the Hudson Yards.
Pretty amazing. I love the uselessness.
"Alaska has a bridge to nowhere, now we have a bunch of stairs to nowhere."
How many more times are people going to post this?
"Hudson Yard's marketing team gets paid millions of dollars a year, but some people will still do their work for free."
I’m happy someone did. I’m a new subscriber to t sub and I’d never heard of this.
"Yeah, same. This is lovely."
Reposting is a victimless crime.
"What are you talking about, honestly you could sell that property for millions and have something actually functional put in there"
Meh
Yes.
Suicide here on Feb 2

I’m surprised it took so long for either and accident or something so sad as this. I went a few months back and wondered how no one ever dropped over doing selfies or dropped their phones.
"Man, this is awful."
"Yeah, the guard rails are surprisingly short. The Empire State Building, Top of the Rock, and even all the bridges now have much higher rails, fences, glass walls, etc. to prevent that from happening."
This could be a good prop in a post-apocalyptic movie and a great location for a stair climbing race.
"Cool, climb all the way up there and you get to see a rail yard and fricken Jersey. Cool."
It is cool. And it isn't finished. That rail yard will soon be a park. The second phase is starting shortly.

That rail yard will soon be a park.
Where will the trains go?
Underground.  Everything is being built over the tracks.
Training grounds.
"It's just a big ""F-U"" to people who don't like the trend of over-luxury development in the city. Real architecture is supposed to improve people's lives. Hudson Yards is just an utterly average collection of glass polygons that blends invisibly with every other generic corporate glass and steel dildo."
Hudson Yards will generate $28billion annually to the state budget that will fund dozens of vulnerable social welfare programs.
Why did they choose for white on the structure? That will probably look disgustingly dirty after a while. Dark brown wouldve been better imo
God I hate this structure
Why?
It’s useless and ugly
""
As do the EMS crew that get called there daily iirc
It has an elevator.
It's also incredibly slow.
Don’t really get how that’s a counterpoint to EMS hating it
"It’s a shame we built Hudson Yards with massive taxpayer subsidy, when the market would’ve built new offices elsewhere just fine."
Was it a subsidy or tax break?
"A lot of the firms that have moved into the new Hudson Yards buildings were given tax breaks to do so, and to move from other parts of Manhattan. Had firms not been induced to do so, it's unlikely that Hudson Yards would've filled up, given that several other newly built office complexes like the World Trade Center have vacancy issues."
"A tax break is a form of subsidy, I don't see what the point of splitting hairs is."
I think the question we should be asking is why
Why do so many people go there and enjoy climbing on it?
"As in, why are you even here?"
Art exists for its own sake.
"I think architecture should have a purpose alongside the artistic value of something, not to say it isn’t pleasant to look at but there’s nothing behind that"
"I’d like to know which camera and lens were used, and also the in camera settings. Any chance you know, OP? Thanks."
"Okay, but is it wheelchair accessible?"
"Has an elevator, but you won’t be able to walk all the way around without going up/down at least some steps."
"Yes, because NYC has no pretentious architecture anywhere else. lol"
Is Dallas known for pretentious meaningless architecture? (I’ve never been)
"Absolutely not. Dallas's buildings are incredibly eclectic, but the city itself is neither pretentiously or meaninglessly built. The people on the other hand... oof."
Yeah the OP clearly doesnt know what he’s talking about
"Let’s just say they built a Calatrava bridge, but didn’t have a river for it, so they created one."
You are being pretentious saying it doesn’t belong nyc
No u

"Is that an elevator shaft on the far left? And why no slide? Or slides, plural? Edit changed right to left, which is right. Right was wrong"
Yes it’s an elevator at the far left.
i love this
Is that a water slide on the left?
Elevator
"Oh so you go up the elevator and down the stairs. That's good because as fun as the water slide might be, it would be negated by having to go up a million stairs."
Is that real? Or cg/drawing?
"It’s real, it’s in Hudson Yards in NYC. It’s called The Vessel"
The 1% really built stairs that lead to nowhere.
So no one is gonna talk about how wide this man’s camera lens is?
Now imagine this was the atrium for an apartment building with an entrance to a unit on each level patch of path - or the interior was filled with apartments with views facing outward.
Can't.. tell if this was taken with a fisheye lense or not.
"Looks like it could be either, and either way this is amazing."
But why is it so damned fugly from the outside?
Looks like something out of Star Wars
What an amazing waste of resources
It draws in tourism and raises property value in the area. It's also a nice deviation from the otherwise homogeneous buildings of New York.
Do you still need tickets to enter?
"You do, but the tickets don’t cost anything (unless you’d want to book 180 days ahead vs two weeks ahead) and are more to control overcrowding."
Damn so long to just visit that big structure of steps.
