Went to the mall at Hudson Yards today.
""
The windows of the main 5 story atrium were dirty.
People were gawking at condo prices in the Hudson Yards sales gallery.
The Neiman Marcus was actually pretty interesting to browse.  It has arcade games and it looks like an offshoot of MoMA.
It’s very 2019.
Wait til 2023 when it’s like the South Street Seaport in 2009.
Completely agree.

Underwater
(Sandy was 2012)
Underwater in the financial sense.
"It devolved into this utterly forgotten commercial wasteland full of very lame stores, and nobody visiting. The hurricane floods drew attention back to it and its experiencing sort of a Renaissance now, but at the time it was even more depressing than the Mall of Manhattan."
I hope the benches are just still in delivery or something...? Or are we doing an upper east side subway station thing and just not providing benches at all
"It's gonna just be a Chelsea Market situation where there are like, four benches in the whole thing unless you're eating at the taco spot in the back. I don't understand their MO at all other than ""take your $15 burger outside, prole"""
I really hate this trend of disappearing public seating! I understand that it’s to prevent transient folks from lingering but it just feels so shitty. Like the “You get NOTHING” Willy Wonka meme.
"i understand that's what it's for, which is why not having it feels shitty to me. it's such a naked effort to create a class division."
I agree. It also forces elderly and less abled people to miss out on places to rest just to provide said class division. For whom?!
I was just out there working last week - nothing is even close to ready. Everything that’s open right now is mostly smoke and mirrors with a few exceptions. They were way too ambitious with this opening date.
I'm really baffled by the escalator situation there. Half were broken yesterday. Half were broken today. The utility staircases are hidden out of sight and generally off limits regardless. The escalators are too spread out for people to be redirected.
I have to wonder how much traffic the upper floors lost out on due to that fuck-up.
The headline attraction to the place is a giant set of staircases.  Maybe the broken escalators in the mall is just another part of the developer's love letter to stairs?
What kind of arcade games?
"I saw skee-ball and some kind of 2-player shooter.  Someone also mentioned there was a Pac Man machine, but I couldn’t find it."
I went to the “grand opening” on Thursday. Hated it. It’s basically a suburban mall. Which would be bad enough if it was 1989. It’s 2019 and there’s this thing called a retailpocalypse due to a company named Amazon and a technology called the internet.
"That aside, it’s just hateful."
"It’s weird because it’s not a good time for brick and mortar retail in general, but upscale-type  stuff with an experiential/Instagrammable component is doing well."
"Locals may shun it, but I can see it doing well simply because of the constant stream of tourists walking in from the High Line and the other new attractions.  Also, foreigners apparently like to shop when they visit because certain brands are cheaper here or not available at all at home."
It’s a similar story with the shops at the Oculus.
These malls would fail if you took them out of the NYC context and plopped them in some random suburb. But they’ll probably do well in NYC unless tourism slows down.
"I own a business and deal with lots of Arabic and Asian clients and colleagues and the first thing they do when they get to NYC is hit luxury stores like Nieman Marcus, Saks, Barney's, etc. Apparently, you can find better deals than in the Middle East/Europe and Asia and don't have to worry about counterfeit merchandise. I don't really get into luxury stuff except, I do like Dsquared2, so I have no idea. However, the number of shopping bags from luxury stores they bring into the office, seems to be a good indicator of popularity amongst that demographic."
Several reasons but:
You do sales right with a more or less good discount
You do not have a sales tax on certain items
You have brands that we do not have easily available
Some american brands are cheaper in the states than abroad
Century21 CK Boxers are roughly 15$ give/take for 3 ...here i pay 20€ for one
Exchange rates come into effect as well
China has a tax on luxury goods as well for instance
"I think a big part of it is also just the willingness to spend money when you're traveling too. Even as someone that's into luxury clothing I maybe spend as much as those guys do in a day over the course of a few years on clothing, however when I'm visiting a new city or country I feel much more inclined to buy fancy stuff even if it's something that I could probably buy back home for about the same amount of money."
Thanks for the explanation. TIL
I’m seeing more and more business models run off the idea of being “instagramable”. It’s such a trip seeing where we’re headed

Counterpoint: I went to a mall when I was in Bangkok called MBK Center and the food court there had some of the best noodles I’ve ever had in my entire life. More than one local specifically recommended checking it out.
"If you ever go back next time, you should also check out the food courts at Terminal 21 and Siam Paragon. The newly opened Icon Siam is pretty legit too, they offer cheap rent to out of province food vendors so you can get some really legit street food in a glitzy mall for a cheap price."
Word! I gotta go back. Such an interesting place.
"Yes, Southeast Asia is full of places like that. Manhattan is not"
"Malls in Asia are great. They often have clean, modern bathrooms, longer hours than local shops, and staff who will try to accommodate the language barrier. And you’re right, they’re a great place to get semi-upscale food at a decent price, often targeting the white collar crowd who work in/near their development complexes."
NYC does not charge sales tax for clothing or footwear priced under $110/item.
Ok so you can buy about three items in the entire mall without paying a sales tax
It's funny you say that because Garden State Plaza is in a random NJ suburb and it has as many visitors yearly as disney world
"Honestly, you just described the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle."
It seems like a very similar project. Time Warner also has a performing arts venue and an upscale mall.
It is the same company behind them both.
"Yes, except about a mile further west and without the park views"
I'm good with the view of the overgrown beehive.
I prefer giant shawarma!
Well I'll never be able to unsee that. Thanks.
I've been there 3 times it's always crowded and there's nothing in there I'm just baffled at all the traffic it gets.
So this is the real reason we kicked amazon out! /s
"On a similar note, you got to admit that it is hilarious seeing the signs making sure Walmart knows they aren't welcome in NYC, but every other brand has massive contrived flagship versions of their stores already there"
I went to the opening on Thursday too! I loved the open bars!
You were able to get to the bar?
"There were like four on each floor, I had to hit up each one for safety purposes and drinking purposes."
I couldn’t get close to the main ones. The ones where there is wine were different but I needed the hard stuff after dealing with those crowds
I think its more of an attraction for tourists. A lot of people like to shop on vacation. You're not going to get many NYC residents going there to buy stuff regularly.
Guess so. I mean look at all the tourists in Times Square
"I went in there Friday to use the the restroom.  What a pain in the butt it is to get around that place.  There aren't stairs to most floors, and the escalators are very inconveniently placed.  And yes, some of the escalators were broken, and security wouldn't let you walk up.  I will be avoiding it in future."
I think the quickest way to a restroom is to enter where the art gallery is (33rd and 10th?) and take one of those elevators to the 4th floor. The restrooms were right around the corner from the elevators. Those were empty while the ones on lower floors had lines.
"Neiman has nicer ones, but it’s trickier to get to them."
"Yeah, I had to take an elevator.  I hate waiting for those.  I'd rather just walk up stairs.  Why are there no stairs?????"
"They got a few shipments of stairways, but the developer didn't know how to install them, so they bundled them up in a big beehive outside the place."
The design makes you spend time walking around to maximize foot traffic. Classic mall trick.
The Oculus does the same thing...there’s no direct way to get to the street from the PATH train without walking past stores.
"Yes, it's clear they want to keep visitors in the place for as long as possible so that they must pass by every store.  But this really seems like a safety issue to  me.  What if there's some kind of emergency?"
""
"My friend was there Saturday, and it was so crowded there were lines to escalators and elevators.  The guards finally opened the fire escapes to let people out."
"Was at the opening on Thursday and the escalators were all working. I went there yesterday, too, and was amazed that a bunch were busted."
"Does seem like escalators break down a lot, in general, in NYC. I can't recall seeing busted ones elsewhere."
"Take a trip down to DC sometimes.  All of the Metro stations (except one) have multiple escalators to get to the platforms from the street level, and they're frequently broken. The escalators in DC are some of the longest in the world too, so an escalator going out is a big inconvenience."
Ah yeah I've taken some of those super long DC ones. That would be painful.
Shit looks pretty wack and crowded.
South Street Seaport.
Manhattan Mall.
The Winter Garden.
"All this has happened before, and all this will happen again."
so say we all
"It's just $25 Billion, I mean, we can't expect clean windows and chairs, it's Manhattan real estate after all. Things are pricey."
:-)
Any rhythm games in that arcade?
I don't get the hype around shake shack. It's not that good IMO.
I have to give props for the great zoom in

"Rats are the best sometimes. Fuck your billion dollars, I'm a rat."
That's a classy rat. Fearless.
Go .1% RATS!   :-)
Has DeBlasio switched gyms?
Yeeerrr omw to get a bagel with cheese fam
wow so New Yorker of you to bring that up like nobody knew that piece of info. You must have lived there for maybe a whole year so your basically a life long New Yorker now. Go kick rocks
"Go kick rocks, bahahaha...that's the quote of the day!"
I like it.  Keeping it classy nyc.
"At first I was like “no, no it hasn’t dumbass!”"
Stayed to watch the vid. Yeah
Zardulu strikes again
hold on. So the place that could have been a Jets home stadium with a mall inside it is now instead just  a fuckin mall?
Pretty much.
thanks i wanna put my head through a wall
It's a floor squirrel
"So, whats there to see? Anything interesting? Or just another bunch of office buildings?"
"it’s a basic as fuck mall that is confusing as hell to get around. if you’ve been to the shops at columbus circle, you don’t need to go to hudson yards."
"I saw the grid layout with all those interconnecting walkways and said fuck it. I'd rather go to Westfield WTC which looks just as bad, but isn't as confusing."
The mall was cool on Friday. Got free coconut water and someone drew a sketch of me for free.
Edit: mistakenly wrote Thursday in my original comment. Friday was the first day it opened.
The malls a pretty nice looking
"It's one of the most heinous buildings we've seen built in the last few years, and that's impressive considering the hall of shame flat glass stock being erected all over the city."
"We keep pet rats, and looking at this one she seems to be an older one! Maybe 2+ years. Congrats on surviving so long, lil buddy."
Can't go wrong with that
New area? That's gotta mean a bonfire's close..
is that you op.?
