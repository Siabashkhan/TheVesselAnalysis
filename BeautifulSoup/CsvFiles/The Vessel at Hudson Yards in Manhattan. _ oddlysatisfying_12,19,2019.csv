"Well now that we know what,  the question is WHY?"
“NOT” wheelchair friendly.
"You...do see the big elevator right in the middle, right?"
"I ""guess"" that's why ""not"" is in ""quotes""."
“maybe”
"Yep, I also see stairs a few feet from the elevator in every direction."
"You see the stairs on both sides of the elevator, right?"
"“Accessible” does not mean “wheelchairs can go everywhere in the place”. It means there are provisions for wheelchair access. Which there are. Because, like, it’s literally not possible for a brand new, multimillion dollar, high profile building to be non-ADA compliant, dawg."
I just don’t understand the point of having an elevator not land on a full floor. Do people with wheelchairs just got to the level above then go down the stairs? Why have an elevator if you still have to use stairs?
"Hmmm I think the photo is deceiving, I am pretty sure that’s not how the floor plan is laid out...unless I’m remembering totally wrong. I’ve only been there once."
