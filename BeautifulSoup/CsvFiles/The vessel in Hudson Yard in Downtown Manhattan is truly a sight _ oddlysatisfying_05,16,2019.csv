Kinda reminds me of the hive in racoon city...resident evil
It's neat but it seems utterly useless. Lot's of up and down stairs leading where? But also why? It looks neat but seems like a waste.
Huh. This is really cool.
I'm surprised I've not seen this reposted 17 times already.
It only opened in the last month or two
It looks weird when u scroll by it real fast
Everyone that read this just scrolled to the top of the page and back
I wanna go down the sharp metal slide to find my power animal.
"Haven‚Äôt been up it yet but it was cool seeing it built in modules. When I‚Äôve mentioned it to anyone here in NYC, they say they aren‚Äôt going to pay money to go up a bunch of stairs. Most cool public displays here are paid for by the City and are free. It is a little odd that they‚Äôre charging a fee and that it wasn‚Äôt provided as a public space"
"It was free when I went, you just had to wait on line to get a ticket."
Weird. I wonder who is spreading misinformation and why?
Probably someone who doesn't like the project.
"This is all its for, though. Taking pictures from. It's godawful architecture"
Was this location used in doctor who?
I doubt it. This is a pretty new construction project. I think that this phase of construction has only recently been completed.
"I think this could be an epic place for a game of some kind. Tag? Archery tag? Laser tag? Paintball? Or maybe a downhill mountain bike track, or BMX course. SO MUCH POTENTIAL."
Shoulda done half stairs half water features.
Someone drew a Pok√©mon based on that
Stakataka?
"No, it was a guy on YouTube, he goes on walks and draws Pok√©mon based on stuff he sees, I think the Pok√©mon this one was based off of was called ""Bigome"""
Cool.
Happy cake day!! üç∞
Thx
