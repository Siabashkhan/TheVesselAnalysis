I have a really hard time caring for that thing. What's so special about it?
Edit: spelling
It’s so tourists can know what it’s like to live in a fifth floor walk-up.
"It’s stairs, THAT LEAD TO MORE STAIRS. How much more special do you want it to be?"
It's stairs that lead up to a beautiful sight of unused subway trains. Ain't that worth BILLIONS?
"They're LIRR trains, not subway trains, and they're not permanently unused, they're just not in use at that moment."

They should have used the money to move the statue of liberty there
It was a private contract not a government one to build HY
Point me to a bigger pine cone.
"It is a tribute to Best Halal Food, a cart on 11th Avenue. The architect was inspired by the shawarma rotisserie."
Oddly it was inspired by those step wells they have in India.
It looks like a futuristic beehive in my opinion.. which actually looks nice.. it just looks like something that would be in the future..
White sauce please!
If the vessel was made of stone and was from 1860 people would love it. But its not and isn't so people hate it.
"It reminds me of the ancient stepwells, which aren't from 1860 but are made of stone."
I’ve never heard of this but the photos instantly reminded me of The Labyrinth movie with David Bowie.
"The developer wanted to create a ""year-round Rockefeller Christmas tree""--a dazzling landmark to draw in tourists... to the surrounding high-end shopping areas. It's called ""The Vessel"" appropriately. It represents the consumer: perpetually empty and desperately needing to be filled by useless material goods."
"I saw the stores. No soul,  just expensive.  You're absolutely right. Post your review on Google maps so I can thumbs it up"
I never wanted to go. I went there. I’m not coming back.
"It's a tribute to Bran the Broken, ruler of the six kingdoms."
It keeps tourists from the neighborhoods where we live.
Absolutely nothing!
"Nothing, it's a NYC billionaire's lawn ornament."
Spoken like a real New Yorker.

"I didn't even know that thing was being built until I saw the end product, and I still ask myself what it's for and what the point is."
It's a monument to the EB-5 Visa program that allows us to sell our country out for a quick buck.
Nothing. Nothing is special about it at all.
"I understand why people don't like this thing, but I'm surprised that people are more shocked by the existence of it, like having a decorative, weird looking building is just not of this world."
"functionally it has merit as a landmark, tourist destination, and a rare free amenity for sightseeing. it was also built with private investment money rather than public money."
"I don't care about the structure at all, but I'm always surprised to see people rant against a privately funded building that isn't big enough to affect the skyline."
where's the outcry when the government spends $12 million on a hunk of cor-ten modern art
"Frankly I rather like it. It's just a cool thing to walk up. It's kinda like the high line IMO. I think NYC could do with more functional interactive work like this, not just a pretty building a huge statue or a super curated garden that 99% of people can never actually enjoy. Once the hype calms down and the doors are pretty much just open for anyone to check out, I'm down with it."
but I'm always surprised to see people rant against a privately funded building that isn't big enough to affect the skyline.
"You have to look at where the private funds came from. Hudson Yards secured (at least part) of its funding through the EB-5 visa program. This allows foreign investors to gain a path to citizenship by investing in areas that need help. In order to for Hudson Yards to qualify for this though, the district needed to be re-drawn to include it as part of the closest district that qualified; Harlem. That's right. This is the district now:"

"online sources say that it's ticketed but free? I defer since I haven't been, but what is the ticket cost and under what circumstances is it free as advertised online?"
The ticket cost is $0. It’s so they can regulate the amount of people on it at any given time.
It is free.
"It is free. I believe I heard somewhere that lot of people assume they can just walk in, but because of the height, they have a strict limit on how many people are allowed in per day to prevent overcrowding which could be dangerous. On a really slow day you might be able to get tickets in person or even just walk in but because it’s still relatively new, your best bet is to “buy” your free ticket online where you reserve a time slot for yourself to arrive."
It is free. You just need to stand in line to get a timed ticket to prevent overcrowding and to go up.
Source: my parents wanted to do the touristy thing so we got tickets and climbed the vessel.
This is like the third post that I see about this thing today...? PR attack?
Most likely.
What's the theme or thinking behind this? Gotta have some meaningful story to it.
Poor people will climb stair that lead to nowhere special.
"Poor people aren't hanging out there. However, contractors must have made giant amount of money off this."
"They will because they believe it'll get them somewhere special though. However, they'll wait in line to climb the stairs but in the end only get rewarded with more stairs and a lovely view of the railroad tracks."

It truly is the most cynical piece of public art I've seen.
We don't give a shit. Tourist might
I thought it was free
"It's an empty vessel of American consumerism. It represents an American consumer's lifelong journey--constantly climbing the income ladder, only to find oneself in the same place with only a slightly changing view: Inward looking, an empty hole to be filled by consumerism. The higher you climb, the deeper the hole you need to fill; Outward looking, you can see some of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the nation, always out of reach no matter how high you climb."
"Public square, but in 3D."
I propose that we refer to it locally as the Big Kebab
Are there still long waits to climb this thing?
Went with a friend a month of so ago. At 9:15 am there was a long line and we were told (while we were still in the back) that the next available tickets for for 4 pm. We walked the High Line and down to the Occulus instead.
There should be a John Wick fight scene on that thing.
Shawarma !!
I don’t understand why you’d build something to look at New Jersey.

Metallic turd.
The nightmare.
