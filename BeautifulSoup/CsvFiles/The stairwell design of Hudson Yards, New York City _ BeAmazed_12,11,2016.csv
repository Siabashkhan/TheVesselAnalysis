"If you can't tell, this is a concept image. It does not currently exist. It is intended to be a sort of landmark where you go up a bunch of interconnected stairs to get a decent view, I guess. It's not actually going to be practical stairs inside a building."
"The piece is supposed to be called the ""Vessel,"" if you are interested in looking it up."
"It works really well for separating people out as they go higher, but coming down there'll be a jam. You can see the staircases at the bottom merge at a central, narrow point."
If it's rated as a fire hazard there'll have to be a queue outside with security only letting in 20 people at a time.
I hope the designer notices before it's too late or it's really going to screw their vision.
"It's a public project in NYC so it won't be noticed until we're hundreds of millions of dollars in, two decades later."
The entire Hudson Yards project is actually private
"It says on the Wikipedia page it's funded by NYC, NY State, and the MTA though? That means they would've had to issue an RFP and go through the government contract process."
"Yeah, it might be a privately designed project, but it's called the Hudson Yards because it's literally built on the Hudson [Train] Yards, which is a huge waiting area for primarily LIRR, as well as NJT and (if I'm not mistaken) Amtrak. It's literally a giant plot of land owned and used by the MTA, and will always be such."
The new skyscrapers are developed and owned by Related Companies and Oxford Properties. They have a 99 year lease on the property itself.
I think it's almost exclusively used by LIRR. Amtrak and NJT use the Sunnyside Yards in Queens.
It's not being developed publicly the mta and such don't have oversight of details like this otherwise nothing would ever get done

Are you saying jet fuel can't melt steel beams?
"On a serious note, it's not about the material it's made from. Anything can set fire if it's hot enough, and it'd be the smoke that collects in the space that kills you, not the actual fire. Even if there wasn't a fire and it was another kind of evacuation, it's still a crush hazard."
There are many ways down from a lot of floors leading to only five staircases. Compare the amount of potential space to those five staircases. There's going to be a bottle neck.
"""Only"" five staircases? That is way more staircases than most office buildings."
"Yes, but they all converge on the same area, directing traffic into the center of a small space. Considering the amount of stairs that feed to each staircase that's a lot of buildup."
"Less build up still than most buildings, looks like 5 exits there compared to one staircase and one exit like most buildings have."
Those stairs would not be considered an emergency exit stairwell as they are not protected from fire or smoke.
"You're assuming that anyone will actually use those stairs. I rarely see anyone going up one flight of stairs when there is an elevator or escalator available, let along nine that I count in this image."
People will call it the beehive if it isn't scaled back.
"It'll probably end up happening, just like the bean . They should just embrace it"
"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_Yards,_Manhattan"
"So, looks kind of like a Shibuya in the making."
I'm actually working there right now.  It's crazy the scale of work going on in such a small area.  Every morning there's a river of men in worn clothes and dirty work boots walking the three blocks there from Penn Station.
"I am also working in Hudson yards. It's crazy the amount of work going on there and I hope I am still there when a majority of it it finished because it's going to look real nice. As of right now though, it's a mess"
Mess is good.  Mess means we have years of steady work ahead of us.
"Ahh good for the workers yea, I actually work in one of the building currently up. I don't mind the construction, all the scaffolding gives me cover when it's raining out."
"Ah, I forgot for a second that there's more than just construction going on.  It's easy to not realize that some of those buildings are actually just barely capable of sustaining human life."
Any cool things to report?
Are photographers allowed down there?  Might make for some interesting images.
Of course.
"Thank god, I couldn't imagine someone building something this impractical in the middle of a city. A lot of stairs to get a good view, nothing else? No caf√©s, seats or anything. It just didn't feel right with all those people randomly standing around, unless it was like a selfie-kind-of-thing."
"Architecture can be art, and not just pure function."
Hudson Yards
What?
"That video is pretty specific.  Who you include, exclude, make prominent, place in the foreground and the background is important.  It sends subtle messages and for lack of a better word is a bit triggering."
What video?
The video that I replied to.  Parent my comment.
I don't see a video when I follow that link.
Must be your browser.  The entire page is a video with text over it.  Are you on your cell?
"Yup, no video on mobile apparently"
MAGA!
"Nice rendering, horrible waste of space if anyone decided to build this."
But pretty cool and can be an iconic thing to draw people and photos and tourists and money and whatnot.
Imagine the same space being utilized with 100% space efficiency for shops/offices or whatever instead. You'd get something that not many people would want to go visit for fun or shopping or work. Not a place you'd want to bring prospective clients for your bigshot business.
"Obviously there's plenty of things in between the extremes but the developers here are trying to stand out. ""Skrytbygge"" in Swedish ~ ""brag-build"" office/statue/infrastructure thing."
"Nope. As soon as you fill in the center of the building you end up with what is essentially a massive staircase rapping around a building, while not granting anymore access. One staircase and square floors is still the most effective option."
Waste of space? Our homeless population is so high that this place will become home to a decent chunk of them. I prefer them sleeping here to people sleeping lengthwise on the subway seats during any rush hour commute. These people are going to feel like royalty in the summer!
Imagine the lovely odors when it's a rainy day and all the homeless pack up in this billion dollar tower .
Central Park is a wast of space /s
"What does ""waste of space"" mean exactly? Is the Grand Canyon a waste of space? Not defending this design, which looks dumb, but I'm always curious what people mean when they say that space has been ""wasted."""
"All the program that could of been on each floor where ""emptiness"" is.  What function does this building provide? Seems like a very expensive set of stairs."
stadiums are a waste of space.
you forgot the /s.  You can't be serious.
People often spend hundreds of dollars to sit in a stadium seat. The stairs here only serve to fill up space and allow folks to look out windows high on the wall. It would be a Keystone Cops scene if security tried to chase the bums and street people off THESE steps!
I think I know where the inspiration for this came from.
Im getting Bee Move PTSD from the honeycomb shape
Isn't this the spy kids HQ set? :-D
Erase all the people stopped between level one/two and the top and you get what this thing would actually look like if built.
That does NOT look ADA compliant.
Wouldn't they just have to have an elevator somewhere?
"There are ADA requirements for stairways also. Handrail of a particular size on each side, a specific distance from the glass, striped nosing of contrasting color, a 23 inch projection of the handrail at the bottom riser, 12 projection at the top, maximum 7""/11"" rise/run, particular handrail height, etc."
"Also, stairway exits on a particular floor have to be separated he by half the maximum diagonal of the floor by regular codes, and one can be a ""monumental"" contraption like this, but the others need to be in a smokeproof enclosure typical with self closing doors and stuff. A big fire in a casino that killed a lot of people in the attached hotel encouraged these requirements."
"edit: oops, thought this was the Architecture sub redit, so was a bit technical."
"Yeah, I'm an architect."
Correct. There will be one elevator there.
whats the point of this giant building if there are no rooms? do you just walk up and down
Probably a semipublic atrium for a highrise apartment building.
this is just a render
Looks like the Galactic Senate.
That's like something out of 'Inception'
"Probably be completed in year 2079, but before the 2nd avenue subway line."
"A co-worker of mine is on a project in the Hudson yards, he's going to  be doing the testing for the concrete/soil etc composition of the newest apartment buildings there. It's a cool project from what I hear :)"
"I wouldn't go there. Seems like the perfect spot for a cinematic shootout, way too dangerous."
This looks like it was designed by Arthur from Inception.
"""According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly....."""
"I mean it is beautiful from this angle at least, but kind of impractical. No one is going to climb those stairs."
R/crazystairs
Looks more like a stairwall to me
This looks like the perfect place to set up a paint ball competition.
r/evilbuildings
If MC Escher were an architect
I feel my knees aching already. I'll take the elevator.
Reminds me of that painting by M.C. Escher
That looks quite dizzying
Whut
"I know it does not exist but for a moment i ws like "" oh hogwarts without the moving stairccases"". But my dream got kicked in the jewels"
Why would anyone build such a thing. It looks like a hamster cage or something. Ya know wood burns and could fill the space with smoke right? Why are all these people climbing stairs for no reason? Are they posing for the camera? Looks like lots of code problems. The handrails don't look like they meet ADA for instance. No contrasting striping either. Back to the drawing board for you.
"I think the concept is sound, but yeah, there's all kinds of issues with those converging stairs at the bottom turning into a bottlekneck."
"I guess if ADA and code compliance were the only measures of great architecture we'd live in a pretty boring world.  Are DMV's, subway stations, and affordable housing more your thing?  They meet all the handrail and stairs requirements.  Somebody's got to have a vision.  Not to worry anyways, it won't get approved or built if it's not compliant."
There's actually gonna be an elevator for people with disabilities
"Doesn't matter. All the ramp and stairway requirements also apply. Disabilities include people with for instance a wooden leg, that climb stairs and can't see steps clearly. The nosing has to be sloped so that the wooden leg isn't caught. There are dozens of requirements just on stairs, since they might be used by elderly, sick, blind, etc, etc.  Its not just about wheelchairs anymore. Architects are supposed to know about this and know how to design with it."
"I dreamt of this staircase, years ago. This exact design. What is real?"
