"I am a native New Yorker and I don't understand the hype vehind the Vessel. It was neat at first to see something new in a neighborhood I didn't really frequent. But since then, it has just been a monument of the stupid-rich and an unfortunate place for people to take their lives. I feel like everyone I've spoken to (other native New Yorkers) have indifferent to strongly negative feelings towards the structure and the development of Hudson Yards in general. Non-native New Yorkers (transplants and visitors) seem to have more of a positive take on the whole thing. I wanted to ask for everyone's opinion."
"Do you feel like we should 1) demolish the whole thing, 2) implement changes to make it harder to jump (nets/higher railings/etc) or 3) leave it as is and let it become part of our city's history and landmark?"
I’m mainly indifferent. It’s a tourist attraction at the end of the high line / near the mall. I can see why some people might have thought it would be good to drive tourists over there.
"Realistically , I doubt they are going to tear it down so I think there needs to be measures taken to safe guard it. A dark part of my mind does wonder what it is about the vessel attracting these suicides - there’s plenty of high places in NYC so it’s not as if removing it would eliminate the opportunity."
"Close to the Subway, so easy commute."
""
"Lots of steps, all with low railing, so ... lots of opportunity."
"Lots of people around to ""witness"" your act, providing a sense of your memory carrying on."
"(especially since they've supposedly made it harder to jump from the GW which used to be the ""go to"" place)"
All just an off the cuff guess though ...
Edit: updated pricing
"for lack of a better term, but this has to be some sort of “record”, right? for a structure to go up and in the span of a couple years have this many incidents is insane."
especially given that for 1 year folks weren’t even really going anywhere due to lockdown.
the temple of wealth and status demands sacrifices
"Damn, so the guy with the speaker in a shopping cart playing a loud ominous sermon was right.."
Now they charge $10 per person to go up
It’s zoned as a public park & open space isnt it?  How can they justify charging admissions?
Because people decided to start jumping off of it and they had to hire extra security
Yeah that’s not how public spaces work
"I was being facetious. The ticket revenue does go directly to security upgrades, I believe it was also supposed to be a deterrent (the idea is you have to pay = less suicides)"
Still… that’s not how public spaces work. If it’s zoned as a public park they can’t charge admissions.
Imagine Central Park charging $5 per person because a bunch of people decided to off themselves in the Bramble.
We’ve already paid 4.5B in public funds for Hudson Yards and that included the Vessel.
It’s illegal to charge again to get in.
http://gothamist.com/2018/10/11/hudson_yards_nyc_taxes.php
"They’re not charging admission for Hudson Yards, they’re charging for admission to the Vessel. Not saying I agree with it, but it’s not ‘illegal’. Also a public park is way different than a POPS, apples and oranges"
Ok I figured you’d be able to extrapolate based on an example so let’s just imagine they’re charging to get into the Bramble bc they need more security.
They were given huge amounts of taxpayer money to build HY and in return they agreed to provide a number of public spaces.
Charging $10 to enter a public space is ridiculous because WE THE PUBLIC already paid for it.
Look on the developer’s website. It doesn’t say “hey we built this awesome attraction - give us $10 and you can climb it but only with a friend!” it says “hey we built this public park with a cool public space come see it”.
""
Yeah that’s not how public spaces work
"Good to know, sad I didn’t go when it was open (and free)."
They still offer free tickets but only 9-11am
"Yeah, they put up tall netting next to the pedestrian path on the GW a bit ago, so it would be much more difficult to jump from there than it used to be"
"Bruh, it costs 10 dollars to stand on it."
"Bruh, it costs 10 dollars to stand on it."
"A year ago, we were discussing reasons people were using it to commit suicide and your “reality check” was that it cost $10 for entry to the top … not that people were killing themselves?"
"I mean, both those things are terrible. People kill themselves, and they skid their legs, increasing prices instead of improving safety. The best they can do is have take-up space while closed, no rebuild railing, no plants placed on the structure, just pile of expensive metal crap."
Is cost really an issue?  Put on a credit card and let Amex sue my estate…
It's purpose was to be a centerpiece of a brand new development because not everything needs to be just concrete plazas and trees.
Except it’s metal and sits on a concrete plaza that’s not that verdant.
I remember the renderings of the continued Highline and public spaces Related put out for that development earlier. They hired the landscape architect for Monticello and made it sound like it would be a parkland paradise. That failed to materialize.
"You must've not been there recently. The trees surrounding the Vessel have grown quite a lot and make it quite verdant. But not everything needs to be a forest... There is proper park from 33rd to 36th. West of 11th ave will be a proper park once those yards are covered. Directly west and southwest continue to be tree-lined, culminating into a proper park on 24th st by the water."
"There are plenty of trees and parkland in the area, I definitely prefer the Vessel over a few more trees."
Hahahahah. You must not have seen the proposed elevations. I saw them again recently when another historic place (on whose board I sit) was looking to hire the same architect.
"I live in the nabe, see it plenty. Just because it’s planted doesn’t make it brilliantly-planned. Related cut every corner they could. It’s still a concrete-bound behemoth."
What do you propose then in lieu of the vessel? A lawn? Some trees?
Why do you care what I think if you’re just here to argue? Try decaf—or a return to your gaming subs.
"Tons of people claiming the Vessel needs to be demolished - I'm just trying to gauge what is a good replacement. Everyone seems to say the same thing: park. Or that it should've just been a park in the first place, along with all of Hudson Yards. Just one big park. But I'm just trying to inform that not everything in this world has to be a park. Not everything has to be some verdant oasis."
"And not everything needs to be a concrete or glass surface here. But for those of us who’ve spent our lives here, more green space is always welcome."
"No one’s dumb enough to think that land worth billion$ would be turned into a mere park, with no commercial viability these days. But it’s reasonable to expect someone who gets significant tax forgiveness for development, adjacent to or inclusive of public space to keep their end of the bargain vis a vis green space."
"And I’ve informed you of all the green space in and around Hudson Yards. And yes, more green space is always welcome and we’ve gotten it or will get it eventually. You would also be kidding if you don’t think they haven’t at least tried around the vessel. Might it be poor design, sure. But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t at least an attempt. Not all design will be good, just like not everything of anything in this world will also be good. Let’s not also forget that the vessel and the immediate surrounding is not meant to be parkland but to serve more as a plaza or central space, because again not everything needs to be parkland.  The parkland portion of it is directly north from 33rd to 36th and also directly west whenever phase 2 commences."
I feel like your post is conflating Hudson Yards as a whole and The Vessel itself.
"I hate the whole concept of Hudson Yards.  Planned developments like that rarely work out, this one is especially bad because it's basically built around being a playground for rich foreign tourists, right down to the eyewatering prices for studio apartments."
"The Vessel itself is pretty cool, and I don't think it would get the flak it does if it weren't in Hudson Yards.  Personally I'm scared of heights and get vertigo so I don't have any plans to go up it, but it's definitely a unique structure with a pleasing design."
That spot was idle for decades. It was going to be used for the olympics or have a developer come in to fix it up. I thought that it was stupid for NYC to host the olympics so I’m in favor of Hudson yards. And… it extended the subway line to go there.
"The Olympics plan included the subway extension, and gave the Jets an actual home stadium. MSG along with Cablevision ran a controversial campaign opposing the plan because it would have taken events away from them."
In a better universe MSG would have moved to Hudson Yards and we could have a tolerable Penn Station again.
Blame the Dolans

"They also stole all this money meant for low income housing to build it. It's truly disgusting. That being said, I'm not sure how tearing down the vessel would accomplish anything."
They should take all the vacant apartments there and give them to the poor and probably impose some sort of tax on the current residents to restore what was stolen.
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/opinion/hudson-yards.html
Yeah the Hudson Yards can go fuck itself.
Let's also not forget the fact that they tried to pull (and actually maybe still attempt to pull) that shit about owning the intellectual rights of all photos taken in that area. This is not a fenced in neighborhood.. this is smack dab in the middle of the city. It's stealing public space if they can fucking pull that shit off.
Also they limit protest in the area and a whole slew of shit like that.
This public/private partnership bullshit is only getting worse. How fucking dare anybody come into the city and make whole city blocks a semi-private space.
I don't even usually get riled up about shit like this. But I took the Hudson Yards shit really personally.
"Where can I read more about this intellectual property rights of photos and private/public spaces? This is the first I’ve heard of it, sounds fucked up, I’m definitely curious"
""
"But hear me out, if you make something that's this visible, yeah ok maybe people shouldn't be able to sell recreations of it en masse or something... but you're putting it in the public sphere, so there really shouldn't be any question of people inherently agreeing to a policy of them giving up their rights to their own photos."
it's the same shit with the Eiffel Tower light show - you're showing the whole city ... people shouldn't have to be worried about taking photos of it and sharing it on social media.
"Everyone does it. There are reports that when protesters record cops, they would purposely sing songs so that the videos would be taken down."
Imagine not wanting to help people
seriously. He jumps from visas to help people who will likely enrich our country (that's what all the studies say) to that comment. Wish we could deport him and let someone else in
This was money allocated for the poor that was stolen. I guess you think money shouldn't be allocated for the poor in the first place?
""
"it's bad, but keep pointing it out. and downvoting those assholes enough so we never have to see their comments"
"Lol, don't think I will troll. Ya blocked!"
"Yes, that is what we want you to do."
You’re citing an opinion piece as fact?
Did they really steal or is it misconstrued to make it look like they stole? The government was done with building low income housing decades ago and decided that developers are better at it. The condition is that developers set aside a percentage of their condos for the poor.
"When it came down to it, it was either to build a bunch of pointless stadiums to host the olympics or spur economic activity."
"Google it yourself if you don't trust me, there are many articles about it. They made it look like Hudson Yards was part of Harlem which is obviously ridiculous."
"I found nothing. It’s all opinion pieces and he said she said. It’s just funny that you’re citing an opinion. Over the last 10 years, there have been nothing exposing any corruption on how billions have been symphoned from any fund meant for low income. Can you explain what they were originally going to do with that money for low income?"
I love Hudson yards. It’s convenient. A lot of nice office space (might be working there soon). They have a great gym nearby. The mall is nice but nothing special but the new Whole Foods (technically not part of HY) is great
Username is very on brand for that comment
Thanks dude!
You sound like a real estate agent.
Username checks out
"What's wrong with liking a nice office space, a nice gym, and a nice supermarket?"
"Nothing, but that comment reads like a Zillow ad lol"
that a very small part of the community will be able to enjoy it.
look at Central Park. A huge part of the city put aside that can be enjoyed by rich and poor
"and here, a space that could have been used for many grander things, and this is what we've got. More offices? More expensive apartments? More of the same? There are so many new and unique things that could have been put on that space that millions of NYers and visitors could have enjoyed for a hundred years"
"Sure, and everyone would balk at billions to develop the spot, leaving it sitting there forever.  Which is why private developers stepped up."
Not everything needs to be a park.
"I didn't say it needed to be a park. Central Park is an example of what can be done with large spaces to benefit many people. There are many other things that would be great for the community, and the entire city."
"People need to work. People need to stay fit. And people need to buy groceries. Without those things we would all be out of jobs, unfit, and hungry. Hudson Yards serves a purpose and I’m sorry you feel left out of it. A city can’t be just parks, affordable housing, and community centers lol"
"Bruh, you have so little imagination if that's all you think I'm talking about"
Not interested in continuing this
"If we didn't build offices we wouldn't have jobs. If we didn't build gyms we wouldn't be able to stay healthy. If we didn't build supermarkets we would have no where to buy food. I would like to have a job. I would like to be able to stay healthy. I would like to have places to buy food. So as a result I support Hudson Yards because I don't want to live in a city where there are no places to work, no places to workout, and no places to buy food."
Good. Since you lost the argument here
I would be disappointed if hudson yards end up being a park
30 Hudson Yards is pretty grand. I would rather blow up the Empire State Building and build a park there instead
"It’s really easy to complain about things. It was a train yard before. Now it’s offices, residential towers, a mall and park."
"It may seem like elitist and there are many pricey condos, but it still generates millions of incremental tax dollars relative to a train yard. And those tax dollars pay for New York City."
Getting to Hudson yards is convenient? Lol
It can be for people who live on the 7 line or who live in the immediate area... Lots of places convenient to you won't be convenient to me because of the geographical differences in where people live in this massive city.
It’s <15 min walk for me
It’s turning into the new version of the NYU library. IYKYK.
"I had to go to Hudson Yards mall yesterday and the shop associate helping me told me there had a been another jumper just that morning. The store had a perfect view onto the Vessel and the guy seemed pretty shaken up so I didn’t probe, but it definitely seemed like it wasn’t his first time seeing some shit."
"Yes, I remember."
IK
i don’t know… can someone let me know?
"i think they're referring to suicides that happened in the building, two in 2003 and one in 2009"
Sound alike we just need to create a new site that’s more attractive for suicides.
Suicide booths from Futurama.
"Yeah, those were the big ones, but there were more. Quite a few people went up to the roofs of their dorms as well. Really sad shit."
When you would look down from the upper levels of the NYU library the floors would have this optical illusion and almost look like there were spikes coming at you and several people jumped from the upper levels. They did install barriers but that was after I graduated.
"man when I went we callously referred to those choosing to take their own lives as the Bobst diving club. Glad they installed those screens, less glad NYU drives so many students to self-harm with how little they give a shit about mental health."
"Hopefully it's changed but the attrition rate and lack of attention paid to students in general (attended from 08-12) was horrific. Basically just said ""welcome to NYC!"" then forgot you existed until you had to pay tuition and housing bills."
mega shawarma staircase
"lmao, sums it up nicely"
Has anyone started calling it the urn?
"I'm indifferent to the actual structure. I visited it once (quite literally, 5 hours before the very first suicide) and it makes for nice photos and is clearly designed to get people to want to go to Hudson Yards. It's pretty meh, but there's many meh things in the city."
""
"Obviously taking those measures isn't going to end suicide (that requires, you know, actual investment into mental health services and a better understanding of why people turn to suicide in the first place, but no one wants to have those conversations), and is more of a ""don't do it....here"" than anything else. But as someone who has struggled with those thoughts in the past, making it even SLIGHTLY more difficult to do anything could deter someone long enough."
"I resent that they took development money out of the coffers for neighborhoods that actually needed it to build the area up. Fuck that building. And fuck their ritzy mall. I get it, there's shopping for different audiences, I regularly shop at uniqlo, but man that place is a soul suck wallet suck space suck. Also fuck the vessel for caring more for aesthetics than safety, there's been four deaths already. I guess this isn't JUST about the vessel but it's just the centerpiece."
Hmm I guess it's less disruptive for someone to commit suicide here.
"The subway, you gotta shut it down."
River? You gotta dredge it.
Someone has to scrape them up off the floor and close off the entire area so it disrupts too. I dont mean to sound harsh but why cant people just kill themselves and not inconvenience society.
"Yeah but diving off a river sucks, they probably deploy a helicopter too which is $40k an hour."
Subways disrupt tens of thousands of people.
Disrupts what? There's nothing there.
Disrupts what? There's nothing there.
Agreed. Harlem definitely didn't need to fund this rich folk venture. It's a 1. For me.
caring more for aesthetics than safety
"Eh, I wouldn't call it unsafe. They were not accidental deaths."
"Originally, there were no retail places I would go to."
"Since then the only place I go to is Greenberg's Desserts. They have amazing tarts and pastries (mixed on their cakes, but I'm not a cake person)."
It’s related co and Oxford property’s money. They can choose to do what they want with their money.
Is there any NYC taxpayers money going into it? I thought they even paid for their own subway station and expansion
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-12/the-visa-program-that-helped-pay-for-hudson-yards
I’m aware of EB5. It’s commonly used by developers. Those are not taxpayers money.
Tax breaks would be considered taxpayer money. It is not unique to Hudson Yards. But the shady part is the gerrymandering that allowed this to happen and put Harlem (and its residents) at the shit end of the stick.
"No it's not. The main con of tax breaks have and always been that the only people that seem to get them are the rich and their corporations. No one pays for tax breaks, it simply is money that is never received. All should routinely receive tax breaks, especially lower income and middle class folks as incentive. Instead we only give rich people and corporations incentives."
"I agree with you, though just a short precision : money not received is still money paid, we just have a bias to think it isn't the same. But rationnaly, it is exactly the same."
That's why you can sue over loss of income caused by something
How is a tax break any different than a hand out from public money? It’s money that the state should’ve gotten from the rich that they didn’t get.
"If I have $100 and give you $100, I then have $0. That is a handout. Money is actually loss because it changes hands and is given to someone else. If I have $100 and give you a $100 tax break, I still have $100. That is a tax break. I could've had $200, but I still will have $100."
That's the difference.
"The problem is that the rich always are the reason why the government has $100 when it can have $200. But I don't see a problem with tax breaks so long as the average joe becomes the reason more often than not. Instead, it's always the rich."
That’s not how it works though.
It would be like if you owed $100 but then only paid $50. And yea sure you took like $10 of those dollars and built something for the “public” but it doesn’t actually benefit anyone.
So now I’m out $50.
That’s not how it works though.
It would be like if you owed $100 but then only paid $50. And yea sure you took like $10 of those dollars and built something for the “public” but it doesn’t actually benefit anyone.
I'm not going to argue on the pros and cons of the actual development given that most of you will never be happy with anything that isn't some sort of park or affordable housing.
"Even within your explanation, the government still gets $50, which is better than the $0 they would get if it was just a bunch of train yards. It's a net gain of $50, which is different from a public handout of $50, which would bet a net loss of $50."
"It is money that could've been used for public projects, I'll admit I am skipping a step but any taxes not collected is tax money to be put back into the community regardless of which income bracket it is coming from."
The idea of tax breaks is to incentivize something that would be a bigger benefit to society than the government receiving the money themselves. The recent child tax credits are a great example of a tax break with the idea that regular families being able to keep the money will produce a larger benefit to society than if that money were to go to the government.
"Just because someone is rich or they're a corporation doesn't mean there can never be benefit from a tax credit, but what America needs to learn is to give less of them to the rich and more of them to the average joe."
"Just because someone is rich or they're a corporation doesn't mean there can never be benefit from a tax credit, but what America needs to learn is to give less of them to the rich and more of them to the average joe."
"This is music to my ears, but the missing detail that you're not mentioning are that tax breaks are something that intrinsically favor privileged parties unless they're constructed to be broadly applicable."
The EITC/CTC extension is a good example. Have kids? IRS have your information on file already? Great. Done.
Anything that requires you to do research/hire professionals can a big roadblock to the average Jane who may not have the time or resources to figure out how tax breaks/benefits apply to their own situation.
"Anyway, not really arguing. I wish the IRS just did our taxes for us, like Canada and other countries."

"EB-5 money is investment money, not grant money. You are saying we should have sold Harlem public housing projects to foreign real estate investors?"
"The gerrymandering is very sketch. But the way this program was intended to work, you’d see a bunch of new luxury housing/offices right in Harlem financed by the foreign investment money, and I have a feeling the anti-HY crowd would have been even more upset by that. YMMV though."
Some of the people in the nyc subs disgust me.
I just don't understand this idea that NYC is just so so so resistant to change so why even bother trying to influence change... NYC is going to change every freaking day whether we want it to or not. It should at least change in a positive direction. Naysayers and doomers be damned.
Eye opening tweet thread.

"Re. the Vessel specifically... my guess is that they'll not let people up it again, but keep it up as ""sculpture"". Weirdly, my non-US friends who have seen the Vessel in person rave about it like it's single greatest work to come along in the last 300 years."
"Not even a little impressed? Regardless of it's usage for the rich, it was literally one of the biggest single developments in years. The cantilever structure above the rail yard and tracks is an engineering marvel too. I can't not find it impressive that there was basically nothing there just a few years ago and now the entire area is different (for better or worse). I only wish transit development moved this quickly..."
"I'm with you on the transit! I think I would have rathered they put the effort into redoing Port Authority and the Times Square Station first, lol!"
"Who do you think is working at Hudson Yards, both in its offices and the mall?"
I like the vessel. I think it’s a cool structural addition to the city. I just wish it wasn’t in Hudson yards which just feels so isolated.
It’s isolated to keep the poors away.
The poors can't find the 7 train?
It's isolated because that's literally the location of Hudson Yards? Where else are they supposed to put a centerpiece for Hudson Yards if not in Hudson Yards?
"the entire complex is designed to be closed off and viewed exclusively from its interior. have you seen hudson yards from 10th av? it's ugly and foreboding. from the inside, it's glitzy and glamorous. its design absolutely exists to keep poors away, or at least discourage them from venturing in."
"I think you're mistaking poor design and animosity over the developer next door as some sort of conspiracy ""to keep poors away""."
how is it at all a conspiracy? it was a deliberate design decision to make the complex look unappealing when viewed from 10th avenue.
"When an architect agitated for a more lavish cladding [for the facade along 10th Avenue], a Related executive waved him away. “Who’s going to see it?” he asked. For the developers, the towers gather round a central stage. The rest of the city is its back-of-house."
nymag.com
"i mean obviously they can't physically bar people from public spaces. but they can (and have, and still make) design decisions to make access as difficult or unappealing as possible. i don't think that's a bombastic or conspiratorial take given the actual and proposed design of the complex"
Hate to sound like an ass..but what’s the harm in wanting to keep homeless people away from your development? Should we open up every single square inch of this city for them to roam and do as they please?
"Literally anyone can walk in. Why do you think NY ""poors"" would find this area too ugly and foreboding, but tourists from Ohio making $30K find it welcoming?"
This is just making things up.  Anyone who can afford a $2.75 subway ticket can get there easily.
I think BigBrad is talking about how there's nothing but luxury housing in that little enclave so most people are priced out of living there
"A lot of people keep saying this, but what's the difference between Hudson Yards and FiDi or the rest of Midtown? It's mostly offices, places catering to office workers, some expensive housing, public plazas and a subway station. How is that worse land use than a train yard, or the rest of Hell's Kitchen/Chelsea next door?"
"Most US citizens are priced out of living in NY, and most NYers are priced out of desirable parts of Manhattan.  You don't see people bitching about the Empire State Building."
Been in NYC 16 yrs….not sure who is deciding that we need luxury malls everywhere….already seems like a relic and due to COVID never really going to take off…seems like a lot of Jersey people hang there…this jumping off the vessel thing is tragic but reinforces the point that we can’t have anything nice
"It's a soulless metal ornament with no meaning other than to be a social media friendly marketing item for a space catering to the rich. Other than the real estate developers and marketing people for the area, no one would miss the ugly meta shwarma if it were razed to the ground. At minimum they need to make changes to prevent jumping. I would rather a festive turd in Times Square get landmark status than this thing."
"I don't get how HY caters to the rich more than any other part of Midtown. There's offices, public plazas, a subway station. How is that worse than the train yard it's on top of?"
"Honestly, now that I've heard it described as metal shawarma I kind of like it more."
"I’ll take an ugly metal shawarma (I disagree with this take, but if that’s how you view it) over a hole in the ground full of trains."
If they tore down townhouses in the village to build this complex I would sympathize more with the complaints. In fact I’d be outraged.
"But they didn’t. They took a hole in the ground and erected a state of the art complex/neighborhood out of thin air. Local businesses over in that neck of the woods (outside of HY) will now see increases in business from people/businesses moving there and tourists going to see Vessel or Edge. It gave us a subway station. Nevermind Hudson Yards - it makes getting to Javits, the ferry and/or river sooo much more convenient."
I’m a fan of Hudson Yards. Always have been and always will be. It isn’t perfect and there are changes I would have made if I had a say - but overall I think it’s an outstanding addition to the city. Especially when considering the fact that it was created in a place nobody visited or lived and it didn’t detract from or destroy pre-existing infrastructure or neighborhood in its development.
More to the point - I love Vessel. Wouldn’t change anything about it. It’s both unique and functional. Would another metal globe be better? A statue of some revolutionary hero? A water fountain?  They did something different - and at least imo - hit it out of the park. It’s a work of art and will be even better when Phase 2 of HY is completed.
Falling apart is a bit much. More than a bit.
"That’s not to say there haven’t been issues, but with a project of that size and scope there are always going to be."
The Shed’s awning failing 3x out of the hundreds of times it has been used is small potatoes.
I obviously didn’t sway you but nothing you offered changed my mind a quark either. They practically built Atlanta on top of a train yard. It was never going to be flawless. And nobody could have (should have) expected otherwise.
Has it been used hundreds of times? In my experience they just plop it somewhere convenient for the next month+ of events. And it didn't move at all during covid. It's closer to a 10% failure rate.
I love Vessel. Wouldn’t change anything about it.
Would you at least be open to higher barriers to prevent jumpers?
Ugly meta schwarma killed me hahaha!
The Eiffel Tower?
"You're the type of person that if any landmark was built during your time, you would hate it. You don't like the vessel but if you were in Paris when the Eiffel Tower was built, you wouldn't have liked it too."
"The WTC memorial is fantastic and I love the high line, both recent landmarks. Refrain from judging people based on nothing but assumptions from your own head canon."
"Sure, but one is a public park and one is a memorial, which isn't traditional development.  You probably hate the Oculus, for example, and would hate the freaking Empire State Building if it was built today.  ""The Empire State Building stands as a monument to capitalism and the mega-rich in a spot that could be used to make work more accessible with low income housing..."""

It's an opinion. People have them. Not sure why folks see fit to pass judgement on total strangers on the internet or extrapolate what else they think others would like.
"Who wouldn't like a memorial for a tragedy and a park? You like those for that reason, and they just happen to be landmarks. But you won't like anything that is purpose-built as a landmark."
"I've literally visited with friends from out of town that make peanuts, and we all had a coffee and enjoyed the Vessel.  It's a fun landmark for people to gawk at."
"The apartments are expensive, but that's new build anywhere desirable in Manhattan.  It's not like Midtown or FiDi new developments are affordable."
/AskNYC loves to rage against basic economics.
Doesn’t it also generate ticket income?
I thought tickets are free timed entry? (unless that's changed)
"Now, the EDGE observation deck (right next door), yeah ... that generates ticket income."
They added an entrance fee after the first deaths to try to deter more.
They made them paid after the first 3 suicides with the logic that people are less likely to pay and then kill themselves.
"Reminds me of the ""Suicide booth"" in the first episode of Futurama."
"Came for the metal shawarma, stayed for the festive turd"
I kinda just don't have an opinion - simply don't care about Hudson Yards and/or The Vessel.  It's an area of NY that I basically never went to before it's construction and will probably continue to not go to now that it's finished.
It's pretty ugly so I had no affection before it started to acquire a morbid reputation. But NYC is full of ugly quasi-art and high places to jump from.
"Edit: not sure why this was bolded and enlarged lol, drama. I suggest something more healing, like a sensory garden."
using a # at the beginning of a line will do that to the whole line ... case in point:
I appreciate you.

"there is def some dark energy that structure is channeling. where it came from, one can only speculate, but there are things we dont fully understand about the world we live in and the energy that suffuses existence - at least as we can perceive."
"Alright Harry, we get you’re a wizard and you have a wand and all."

"Welp, the Vessel is now metal."
"Perhaps the minority here, but I really like the Vessel. 😅 I think it’s really pretty, and it’s nice being able to get nice views for free."
it's not free anymore lol
It's no longer free. Free for the opening hour but $10 onwards!
Yes - but you're acting like that's a con. It's not free anymore because people killed themselves and they added a fee as a deterrent.
That fee won't stop anyone if they want to go
"Well that's what they learned lol. So they did that and made it so you can't go alone. This kid went with his family, they all paid the admission fee, and he jumped in front of them."
"also that is even more fucked up, damn do we live in a very sick society."
What adult cannot come up with 10$ in a day though?
"You need to come up with $10, find someone to go with you, and have the foresight to make a reservation."
"I don't think it's a con. It is private property, they can charge however much they please."
The developer is worried about aesthetics but they should be building higher barriers or nets or a combination of them just to help. Of course we need more healthcare funding overall and help for people who need it.
"As a person who has been suicidal before, I would not have jumped from anywhere, but I understand the thought process and sometimes being delayed or dissuaded just enough is enough for you to get your bearings back and pull back until you can get help."
It looks like a skeletal ribcage to me. It reminds me of vultures who ate the meat off the animal and now all's that's left is the bones and then they charge you $10 to climb the bones then teenagers get so depressed about the symbolism of it all (the reality that there's no sustenance left for them anymore) that they hurl themselves off the totem and kill themselves in front of their families.
"I walk past the vessel almost every day on my commute to work, or else I might not have an opinion. I work in the arts and at first I thought it was at least an interesting sculptural piece of architecture (though hated the whole concept of developing the area for the ultra rich) but ever since the first person jumped, that is all I can see when I look at it. Why after the first person jumped off it did they not put up physical barriers? Does the architect or developer object to it for aesthetic reasons? Why not make it safer/or reimagine it?"
"After reading about the kid who jumped yesterday, and then seeing the nonstop photoshoots that go on in front of it (even mere hours after that child's suicide), it just disgusts me. It is, as a friend said to me, ""A monument to disaster capitalism""."
I'm from Manhattan.  The Vessel is just some shitty corporate art.  I don't care what they do with it.
It's a suicide magnet and I'm offended at the excuses given for not raising the damn railings - life/death are more important than aesthetics
This world would be a much worse place if everything had to be suicide-proof before we built it. From balconies to terraces to train stations.
"I agree not everything must be suicide-proof, but at this point The Vessel is a suicide magnet. Notorious attractions breed suicide without precautions - particularly the Vessel because its low railings have been well-publicized. I can think of no comparable attraction open to the public in this area at that height with lower railings."
Stairway to nowhere.
"Was always going to be a tourist attraction, and being outdoors it's COVID friendly."
"Practically speaking, the only option is to attempt further safety improvements such as higher railings.   Demolition is not really an option."
"Demolition is always an option, but considering the cost of construction and installation, I very much doubt it is something they would ever consider, especially without having a clear plan of what to replace it with (and short of a fountain or some sort I can't see it)."
“Stairway to Nowhere”
"I like it. It aptly represents the vessel. It’s empty, vapid, and a place where people can take pictures for their social media. You get to the top and what do you get? Nothing. Maybe some will catch on and self-reflect on the whole piece but probably not. Maybe that’s why it’s becoming a spot where people jump off."
Stop being so cynical.
Lmao I remember when the renderings came out the first thing my colleagues (architects) and I said was someone’s gonna jump from it. It’s a cool concept but a waste of money and now def going to be useless if they they close it again. They should raise the glass railings higher (make it like a glass wall) so it looks connected to the level above to potentially not kill the concept and call it a day. I doubt they’d demolish it.
"As a native tho, Hudson yards is 🚮"
They closed it after the most recent suicide and it seems to be permanent barring any design changes (like a glass wall).
"It's fine. I don't mind it. It's not crazy amazing, but whatever. The main thing is they need to make it stop being a suicide magnet. Higher railings. Fences. Whatever it takes."
"Finally, something sensible. Can't believe how many people get angry at something that used to be nothing, as if the nothing is somewhat more beneficial."
"People don't like new things. In 100 years, if it's still up, it'll be a treasure and New Yorkers will go to war to protect it. And if it gets torn down, people will act as if it was the greatest urban work since the old Penn Station before its run was tragically cut short."
I'm really looking forward to the new Penn Station. What is currently there before construction is pretty bad. I haven't seen any major public outcry about it yet but that might because the bar has been set so low...
And also so high!
I’ve always found it kinda silly. And Hudson yards in general is so artificial.
I can’t believe it was reopened without barriers though. How many suicides does it take for something real to get done? Maybe the answer is four. These developers have blood on their hands.
Other than the suicides which is aweful and protections need to be made to stop them it's a tourist trap. It's a unique responsibility fun thing to do for a whole family except if you have elderly people who won't be able to walk the stairs. It's a unique and decent tourist trap.
There is an elevator.
"So many people don't seem to know this.  I haven't gone up (but wouldn't mind it), but it was interesting seeing how they fit an elevator with rails up the inside curve of the structure."
Blood sacrifice to the soul collector!
It was a 14 year old child that just killed themselves so idk about this comment
The only good thing about the vessel is that they pay 22-24/hr. That's about it.
Just add fencing/railing so people can't jump.
"Strictly in terms of art, I don’t like it. Looks kinda dystopic to me, I’d prefer something more positive feeling. It’s hard to describe. Gives me a feeling of dread when I look at it. I don’t think it’s anything like the Bean in Chicago, there’s a lovely park near the Bean and it was very lively there."
"I haven’t been to that new floating park yet, but looking at pics, I like the idea of that much more. Still futuristic but by including nature, it reminds me of some of the cool greenspaces you see in photos of Singapore.  I’m also a fan of the greenery on the Highline, thought that was genius to freshen up and give “life” to what used to be pretty derelict looking stuff. They’ve added lots of greenery to the East River and I think that’s looking much more lively and fresh too. In China, they’ve added miles and miles of flowers and greenery to highways and roads, it surprisingly does a lot to make it look nice. You can see I have a preference here :). What if it was all green plants and flowers along the exterior of the Vessel?  The shape is still kinda interesting but would make it less ugly to me."
The whole space is dumb as fuck but if you've got some money to burn little mercado Spain is good
"The vessel becoming a landmark for suicide is such a perfect legacy for Related and the entire Hudson Yards project. It is a stunning testament to the people that stripped billions in funding from the poor to build a glamorous enclave for the rich. How fitting that they should have to be confronted with the visceral, human suffering that they would otherwise happily ignore."
"I’m with Jerry Saltz in his assessment of its value, calling it the “Shitgibbon” when he first wrote about the “arts” infrastructure HY developer Related was boasting. It’s a gold-plated commode."
"It’s a quandary. I agree with the sentiment they should have constructed effective vertical barriers after the first incident. But they didn’t, be that their denial, cheapness or both. Now that they’ve instituted no solo visitors and a fee—and still attract those who would jump—I think they should just close it."
"The behemoth that is Hudson Yards is a tax-advantaged boondoggle. So it wouldn’t hurt them a bit to deconstruct it. Otherwise, leaving it up  will only see it labeled as a symbol for the 1% that space was intended to serve—and suicide."
"It’s not the first public space we’ve had that continually attracts in this fashion, but the association could never be shaken."
"I'm not from New York but I've visited a lot and lived there for a summer. Have yet to see the Vessel. I feel all cities are doing obnoxious shit like this. Like how Lower Manhattan and the WTC area is being developed. For who? Rich people? I would rather money go towards better transportation infrastructure or affordable housing, not some stupid building to make some architect feel better about themselves."
"the vessel looks like a gyro. hudson yards is a monument to gentrification, and the developer used some legal loophole to siphon off money meant for NYCHA complexes in upper manhattan to put towards its development. the fucking worst. truly despicable."
"the vessel looks like a gyro. hudson yards is a monument to gentrification, and the developer used some legal loophole to siphon off money meant for NYCHA complexes in upper manhattan to put towards its development. the fucking worst. truly despicable."
It's really stupid and hideous. More galling are all the tax incentives that went into facilitating it and the surrounding complex.
Just my opinion as a native New yorker. I think it's ugly . I think they should put nets up for sure
"Hudson Yards was partially paid for with funds from a visa program that was meant to go towards low income housing in Harlem. I despise Hudson Yards and everything in it because of this. That money was supposed to go towards the housing crisis in this city, and instead it went to a playground for the elite."
NYC needs more affordable housing desperately and instead we made an 87th fancy park
""
"It’s shit. When you’re up close, it looks kind of cool, and pretty big, but then you walk on the part of the High Line that stretches out closer to the river, and you look back at the Vessel and see that it is FUCKING TINY compared to the high-rise luxury condos that surround it. The Vessel is what the peasants get to enjoy while the super rich get to enjoy the rest of Hudson Yards. Seriously, FUCK Hudson Yards."

"In general, I like development and economic growth for the city.  I don’t know the economics behind Hudson yards but if it brings business, jobs, tourists, and new residents, this is a positive IMO.  The shawarma thing is cool, I guess, but always (ALWAYS) think of the suicides when I pass by.  More gates/fences like they have over the George Washington Bridge may be helpful."
They used Empowerment Zone tax credits to build this.
From HUD:
Empowerment Zones (EZs) are designated areas of high poverty and unemployment that benefit from tax incentives provided to businesses in the boundaries of the EZ.
"Stephen Ross, the developer, was/is a fundraiser for Cheeto, and therefore he got a very generous interpretation of “boundaries.” Fuck him, and his shitty billionaires mall."
Well that’s gross.  I wasn’t aware of this.
"You do realize that tax incentives don't cost any money right? It simply means money that should've been received is not received in a future time. I'm not supporting it, but to act like Hudson Yards isn't anything but a net gain (even though it could've been a bigger net gain for the city's tax coffers), is stupid."
It would have been cooler if it wasn't just stairs.
I’d like to see a fashion show there.  (Starting at the top obviously so the models don’t get exhausted.)
"The Vessel is a textbook example of an attractive nuisance. I think it needs to be torn down because I don't see a way of modifying the structure to protect visitors without ruining the effect. It doesn't provide anything of value to natives or tourists, because you can enjoy the vistas of NYC and the Hudson River in much safer ways."
""
"ETA: Perhaps hypocritically, I like window shopping in the mall, especially at Christmas. But it's overpriced and the food options suck."
"I always felt confused about it; It looked ugly, seemed pointless to visit but somehow people liked going there lol."
The funding and tax breaks behind this project are terrible. They somehow tied the area to poor neighborhoods in Harlem in order to get the coin for Hudson Yards.
""
It’s an eye sore and a pit of corruption. I wish it would disappear or they can use it for some better public space that the city needs.
It's too bad I didn't get to visit it before it was shut down.
"oh don't worry, they'll probably just open back up in a few weeks."
"If you actually looked deeper into it instead of just constantly assuming the worse, the prevailing plan right now seems to be that the Vessel will be closed forever barring design changes that will make it suicide-proof."
"Well when it happens 3 times already with minimal (and insufficient) restructure of safety protocols, I think it is okay to assume that major changes were never a top priority."
"We only know for sure that the changes were insufficient now that a 4th person has jumped off. You could've guessed or had thoughts it would be insufficient, but there was no way to know for sure."
"People are also acting like making design changes to the Vessel would've stopped suicides, not realizing all the other potential suicide points throughout Hudson Yards. Once you fence off the Vessel, where do you stop? Do you also fence off the various terraces throughout the development? Do you fence of the atrium in the mall? Do you dam the Hudson River so no one can jump into it from Hudson yards?"
"Mental health is a battle with the self, and not a battle where society has to bend over backwards to encase the world in bubble wrap to prevent mental health issues. No one is ever to blame for anyone's suicide, even including the person who committed suicide."
"I don' t understand why they don't leave The Vessel in place but close it to the public.  It looks cool, but it seems to invite suicides."
"Kind of useless that way. It's a structure basically designed around the experience of being in it and taking pics for Instagram. They basically just need to add anti-jumping measures while attempting to preserve the general aesthetic of the vessel. It'd probably be as easy as adding a bunch of glass panels next to the sides, though I'd hope they'd spend the money to do something less intrusive."
"Haven't see it, it's ugly as shit, don't care."
vessel dumb asl
i nothing it
Never had much interest in visiting it. Have passed by it once while traveling. Just another area that isn't designed to cater to the average Joe. Life goes on.
""
"I don’t like the Vessel or Hudson Yards. I waited on the heads of Related, who own that shit. They were as you’d expect."
Native Ny'er. It's horrible and so is all of Hudson Yards.
"They are probably going to need to add glass or bars on the exteriors to prevent people from jumping off. I don't think they'd add netting because the shape of the structure makes the addition really problematic. I think they should probably remove the group entry requirement after these changes are made because I don't think it's that much of a deterrent (they'll place you in a group if you don't have one yourself), and I think physical changes are ultimately necessary if the vessel is to remain accessible to the public."
keeps the tourists away from the real parks. Great
"The only joy I gleaned from the vessel is that while they were building it I would be dropping my bf off at the megabus. We would make fun of it and try to figure out wtf it was, we called it the Hive and I was certain at one point (pre staircase placement) it would be a fancy parking lot. But now? Another ugly piece of art in a part of the city that’s not for me or for most anyone who lives here."
I don't like the vessel because I think it is a symbol of the hive mind mentality that the rich want the poor and Middle class to live by.
"Native NY - I think it is fugly, I have no desire to go, but if it brings money to the city from tourists then whatever. They won’t take it down but I’m not sure how they can make it safer."
""
Should have built stadium there for Giants/JETS as some wanted. 🤗
Never even heard of it until yesterday. Seems about as dumb and pointless as The Oculus.
Not sure why people care if the Hudson Yards are developed though. What does being a native New Yorker have to do with that? I’ve never gone there in my life and don’t plan on it. Makes no difference to me what they do over there.
This is city for rich people and has been for a while. Another fancy neighborhood isn’t changing anything.
"You mean that giant beehive thing? Waste of space, probably shouldn't have been made in the first place but it's probably not worthwhile to tear it down. Nets or higher railings would probably be a good thing."
It’s ugly af.
I’ve always thought it was hideous but I doubt they would ever tear it down. Best thing they could do at this point is put up nets
Honestly just rename is giant shawarma
Why do you have to name drop being a native new yorker?  Are we supposed to defer to you or something?
I noticed a split in my immediate circle and that was just something we had in common. I didn't mean it in a condescending way. Just wanted to poll the POV difference between natives/transplants/visitors. Its not uncommon for people to make this distinction on this sub. The answers you get will vary depending on your experience of the city.
"I think it's really interesting that it evoked such a response in people. I think that in it of itself makes it iconic. It doesn't really seem that out of line with the style of the Upper West Side otherwise, Lincoln Center and the buildings above have for a while been more modernist than the rest of Manhattan."
"TW: It's also obviously disturbing that four people have thrown themselves from it. Either a powerful protest or a genuine thought of appreciation for the view, I don't know, really sad."
"We're recent transplants. I think it's spiffy in the grandiose way that makes New York and other places notable and fun to visit (stuff so crazy you can only see it in places like NYC, Vegas, etc). Beyond that I'm fairly indifferent - we went and looked at it cause it's stupid to ignore cool things just for the sin of being touristy, it was definitely something different and worth going to look at. Wasn't worth paying to go up it, but if that's what people want to do then more power to them. Which, incidentally, is also how I feel about people committing suicide from it so long as they're not falling on innocent people. A shiny tall building doesn't make people kill themselves, they were gonna do that anyway - it just makes the underlying problem more inconvenient to ignore than if they'd simply jumped in the river"
Demolish it. 4 suicides in 2 years is too many. It has no positive history and at this rate it never will. A depressing sight forever.
2 - how many people have to die for the city to realize its not safe
There were proposals to build a football stadium on that site (instead of Metlife Stadium) for the Jets and Giants and it was also floated as a site for a new Yankee Stadium. According to the plans the batter would have been able to see the Empire State building from home plate. Both rejected for what we have now. Please mourn the dead but fuck the billionaire owners.
"You do realize that sports stadiums are billionaire handout eyesores, right?"
So was this monstrosity. The tax breaks and low interest loans they got for this is a disgrace.
"Better than a stadium, at least."
"I like The Vessel. Tourists need something to take pictures of (like The Bean in Chicago), and the Vessel fills this purpose."
The downside is all the suicide and death.
"I suggest they erect a ""trapeze net"" around the base to catch all the jumpers without ruining the look."
It's a centerpiece to what used to be a bunch of rail yards.
"Native here too. I’ve never understood the appeal and was also against the development of Hudson Yards in general. I’m not against all development, but we all knew what Hudson Yards was going to be and who it was really for. Demolish it. (Edit- demolish the Vessel. Sorry to the artist tho)"
"personally dont care for hudson yards, but i think shitty tourist traps like the vessel are overall healthy for the city's future."
It's fine. Not sure why everyone expects NYC to be something it's not at this point. Do you also rant about the aesthetic of Times Square?
The Vessel?  The true name that this place will be remembered by is Suicide Shawarma
"What gets me about The Vessel is its not even that amazing or nearly as big as I had imagined it looking at photos and videos. I have been to Hudson Yards exactly once, and we ate at a restaurant on the third floor- you could see the vessel from there and it looked dinky and sad. I felt like you could probably get similar or better views from going to the myriad of other tall buildings in NYC."
"Plus, how did the thought not occur to people early on that it would be a prime spot for ending lives. It is a hollow staircase high off the ground with no nets or safeguards..."
"As someone who values diversity, inclusion, and equitability in public architecture and design - I think that they should do more to ensure that the people jumping off the Vessel to their deaths are more representative of ALL New Yorkers, and not just tourists, or transplant bankers or medical residents from Ivy League schools."
Having a few Whites jump off the Vessel to off themselves doesn't discount White institutional power and White privilege. You're lost or in denial. The White demographic have consistently outpaced every other group in wealth and opportunities to acquire more of it.
"Exactly.  This is why I also support reforming the estate tax so that when affluent white people who have accumulated wealth take a gnarly header off of the Vessel, they aren’t able to use a loophole to transfer unearned wealth to their descendants tax-free."
"It's literally a monument to capitalism built with public money that people who are despondent and ground to dust by the pandemic, economic crisis, and climate disaster use for killing themselves. Or insta thirst-traps. I say we keep it."
Not native but seems kinda lame.  Like I still don't want to go to Hudson yards and I don't care to ever go on it.  It's a little weird when I see people post with it online.
Millionaire’s playground
"Other than that, I don’t see the purpose for it."
"Oh yeah, a playground for Instagram and Tik Tok “influencers”."
"All the stores in the mall, you can find at more convenient locations in the city."
"I would have liked to see it once but I refused to go when it first opened because I didn't want to have to get a ticket at 8 am. I figured I'd see it someday, but now I really have no desire - there's got to be negative energy around it (call me superstitious) but I wouldn't be allowed to go anyway as someone who would most likely go alone."
"It's an art installation, basically, and it should probably be taken down. Yeah you could put netting up but then what's the point? It's not like a bridge that has a functional value."
"Lastly, Hudson Yards stole $$$ from Harlem to create all of that, and I really wouldn't shed a tear if I never ventured over there again."
Millionaire’s playground
"Other than that, I don’t see the purpose for it."
"Oh yeah, a playground for Instagram and Tik Tok “influencers”."
"All the stores in the mall, you can find at more convenient locations in the city."
"As for the Vessel itself, bulldoze that crap."
"Demolish the Vessel to prevent suicides? Well, there's the Edge above!"
The Edge actually has glass barriers that require SOME effort to climb.
"Still, if there is a will, there is a way!"
"That thought alone is making my hands sweaty with anxiety. I hated being there, but I do like the food at Peak."
"Moved here 5ish years ago. I had been very indifferent previously, but with all the deaths there (and the warnings given to the developer prior to opening it), my feelings are now (a) soft distaste towards people who visit it, and (b) strong distaste that it's still open to the public"
Get rid of the Vessel. Then get rid of Hudson Yards.
There's not much to think about it.  It's a novel (tourist) and interesting-looking attraction designed to bring people into the neighborhood to spend more money.  It's not exactly a thing most people are expected to hang out on regularly.
"It's for two crowds: A) The Instagram set, and the B) suicidal. Take it down, put up something else that a person can't commit suicide off of, and the Instagram set will come back to see the new thing."
"I like it a lot.  As someone who has attempted suicide in the past, I personally think that the idea of dismantling a structure or closing something because of someone's choice to take their own life is just preposterous."
"Doing all this is just to massage the feelings of the people who drove this person to commit suicide at the vessel: ""oh it wasn't your fault and there can't be any connection between the fact that your son chose to kill himself in front of you and the reasons why he chose to end his own life, if the vessel had been better protected, he wouldn't have done it."""
"That's BS.  When my first attempt didn't work out, I started thinking of other ways.  If the vessel was around when I was depressed and they put up nets and tall railings, I'd have found another way."
"All of this just distracts from the reasons why this kid chose to end his life.  If I had successfully ended my life and someone blamed a tourist attraction instead of my overbearing parents (I don't know what this kids situation was), I'd roll in my grave."
It’s cool. Maybe add some protection
It must remain. Things happened there that have occurred for decades on too many bridges or skyscrapers.
"The question would never come up in those cases. Security, cameras, rails or other barriers. The structure is unique and compelling."
But then the problem isn't The Vessel. It never was.
""
"Disclaimer: I am a ""non-native New Yorker."""
They should put big pointy spikes on the ground around it.
IDGAF
"at this point, the people complaining about HY and the Vessel are more annoying than the thing itself tbh"
I couldn't care less about it. It is not appealing to my eye but that's just a matter of personal taste.
Whatever
Hudson Yards is great because that area was a wasteland and the only other good use of it would've been a stadium which admittedly would've been awesome but would never have actually happened.
"Couldn't care less about the vessel, there are no shortage of ways to kill yourself if you want to. I do think it's an interesting art installation though, even if it's closed."
"I get that it has a nice view at the top, but I feel like the architect just wanted people to exercise and climb a bunch of stairs. It’s really tragic that it doesn’t have proper railings to prevent people from jumping."
I'm pretty indifferent. It's kind of cool I guess? but it make 0 impact on my desire to go to hudson yards (and I say that living 4 streets away)
Never seen it.
"I think it's ugly. But it's already here, so yeah demolishing doesn't make sense to me... As for the unfortunate incidents surrounding it... Idk. Weird topic. I don't know how to parse it. Like every thing that aids people with choices is... verboten? I don't know."
"Most landmarks are ""monuments to the super rich"" that look cool.  If the Vessel was made 50 years ago you'd consider it a staple instead of a tourist/transplant spot."
I hate it
I visited a couple of times and climbed once. One climb is enough.
I like when new things open up in the city. I went to little island the other day.
"I wouldn’t be surprised if the vessel gets torn down or replaced in a couple of years but if it is attracting visitors and helping the city, it’s gonna stay."
Wtf is the vessel ???
The panopticon concept has some consideration here. And I think the comparison w the NYU library is interesting.  I really hate the netting on the gwb but we keep building things that people want to jump off of.  Somehow the vessel thing seems so obvious
It’s ugly as fuck
"Its bad public art.  Without any of the other factors it would still be bad public art.  And thats my biggest problem with it.  Its just not good.  Think about the bean in Chicago.  Anish Kapoor crushed it.  Its a huge tourist spot and it enhances the area.  I know they arent the same but Cleopatra's needle or the Lichtenstein Sculptures or even the Robert Indiana Love sculptures are good examples of public art.  The vessel just isnt and it kind of represents the worst of current real estate developer culture. Singapore/Dubai on the hudson not withstanding the whole place feels not like it doesnt belong in nyc.  Strangely, for me at least the office building are the best part of the whole complex."
Couldn’t give less of a shit about the huge pile of mediocre-at-best that is Hudson Yards
"Native New Yorker. I've always thought it was hideous and pointless. I say tear it down, although that probably won't happen."
it’s a complete waste
Pretty cool. Didn't go up though
"Not a NewYorker , moved here from 2021 ! Saw it first when I went to Javits center for Covid shots … I think it’s an interesting architecture, picture worthy and goes well with that fancy mall that was over there …"
Same
Looks ugly
Have never actually been in it so I won't go so far as to say what 'we should do'.
yeah a huge metal wasp nest & a bunch of overpriced luxury stores and apartments is a no for me. I have zero reason or desire to ever spend time over there.
now that it’s there I guess making it safer would be good? I don’t know. I mean I’d personally love it to be gone but I don’t think sinking even more money into it just to get rid of it is the best use of resources.
"Leave it alone. If people want to commit suicide, they’ll find something else to jump off of or another way to do it. Native NY’er BTW."
"I went the day before the incident. I'm basically a tourist who got an opportunity to stay in NYC for the month of july. I think the vessel is an attractive tourist attraction, but when my friend i went with told me it was a jumper attraction, that made me eerie. Yet, I also couldn't imagine, as I mostly never have been able to with suicide, paying and going to the top and jumping in front of family and a slice of the world; it scares me all too much. I'm glad I got to go experience it the day I did and that I didn't experience what happened a day later. It makes no sense that walls could not have been higher in the first place. The barriers genuinely *feel* too low, especially as someone simply afraid of heights. It's not like people go up there for fresh NYC air as opposed to a view."
