It looks like a pine cone.
It does indeed!
I thought it was a wasp nest
"Don't let the conspiracy theorists hear you say that, they'd go off on this one."
Does it?
Eh?
It looks like a pine cone.
Thanks Sonny.
We've already come up with a derisive nickname here in New York: the shawarma
"I work a few blocks away, and have been calling it 'Trash Basket'. The ridiculously ugly glass building on 9th Ave. is 'GoogLexa' because it looks like a smart home-assistant device. The building with the cool jutting balcony .... no name yet. I think it looks pretty aersome."
Avengers' tower?
That's what I've been calling it!
I’ve heard a lot of people call it this. Keep it up and this will become the norm. We got this.
I like The Duck
The Deranged Duck.
What even is it? Just a big walkway structure? Does it serve any purpose at all other than an adult-size climbing gym?
"""What if we made a park that was made up of only the stairs you use to get onto the high line?"""
Nope
It's a bunch of identical stairs all the way around plus a stupid elevator for accessibility reasons. There's not even anything inside it.
"It's a sculpture that you can walk on, if that makes you feel better about it."
I can’t wait till nobody uses it in 4 months.
"or, it becomes the new high line. hard to tell."
"At least the jiggling gets your from one place to another, and you see a variety of things on your walk this....."
Also I hear the high line has been loosing hype lately
"I prefer ""The Social Climber."""
This is perfect

"Very Interesting but the video is a few years old, so I'm wondering how it has progressed since then and if things have changed."

Incredible construction however. I’ve always heard that implementing new infrastructure designs into NYC is a massive hassle so I wonder how long this will take them
"FYI the YT video linked isn’t an official one for the development, he’s got his own channel and covers engineering projects globally. Also I know loads of people who speak like him ?"
London
"Well I say London because they’re from all over London. Inc, Brixton, Hampstead, Richmond, Twickenham, Hammersmith, Holland Park..."
"Maybe you’re right, just pointing out that these people do exist, they’re not fictional - so the rest of the world knows and all"
Are you implying that those who are less well off are of a different race? Cause that’s not at all what I was trying to say. If that’s the case then I’m afraid you’re a little racist yourself.
Ehhh. Classist at worst.
Exactly!
""
"I was on the high line this last december, did it finally finish construction ?"
I believe it was completed recently and the grand opening was sometime last month(Feb).
It’s grand opening for the shopping part of the development was Friday.
Yes! It opened to the public yesterday. Unfortunately you still have to reserve a ticket
I saw that whole project go through in a show called Impossible Engineering
"Am I the only one who hates the name of that show? How could you make a show about things that have been made and then call it ""Impossible"""
"It’s to show the masses that seemingly impossible engineering problems can be overcome, to wow the audience of the wonder of engineering, and to perhaps inspire younger people to take a career in the field."
Or it could just be marketing?
Its probably both tbh

u/actionkid105 did a fantastic tour of it on opening day

"I should have said he explored Hudson Yards, not specifically The Vessel."

"Clicked on the vid, got sidetracked for about an hour watching it and other linked vids...now back here to continue..."
"Ahhh, the Internet. Has there ever been anything better/worse for wasting time..."
So it is done then? I was there a few months ago and thought it was the inside of a building being constructed before the outside - very cool
"I worked on a staircase that went to one of these buildings. It was an absolute nightmare for everyone involved. We shoulda known though, only 2 other companies had a bid in for it and neither of them are located in the US. Turned out really cool looking though"
That sounds pretty awesome but I can’t imagine. What caused it to be a nightmare to work on?
It was awful mostly because of the engineering. We had one guy working on it and every step of the way kept throwing out little nuggets like ‘I Hope this’ll work’ or ‘oh it’s gonna be a mess on site’. It was structural tube and angle with white powdercoated cladding that had to be welded after powder coat. Basically every step of the way it was shit.
Newspapers here are reporting that it was built in Italy and shipped.
"It wasn’t this staircase, there’s an entire rebuild of Hudson yards, the staircase I worked on was for 6 flights for the paramount offices up there."
I'm pretty sure I've played this map on Halo.
"I remember seeing this under construction a while ago, I can't wait to go see it now that it's complete"
Looks like a transformers ribs.
Civil Engineer dream Engineer who had to make it safe nightmare Construction workers death
Nah. Architect's dream. CivE's nightmare.
Looks like an upside down pine cone
It's The Hive but above ground
Is this actually real or a render?
It’s real also with no filter. I’m surprised as how it came out
I'm surprised something that looks like this exists & I never saw it before. Did you take this picture on a pixel device?
I took it on an iPhone X actually!
In an earth quake that thing would roll

Is this the garden place that they have in one of the Hitman movies where he meets that old guy? (Sorry guys the names/the movie were/was forgettable)
"$200,000,000 dollars to make..."
We can't afford healthcare but we can afford a 200 million pinecone you can climb.
My uncle is one of the heads of construction for Hudson yards. Truly sounds like it’s going to be amazing.
The challenges they had/have to overcome building over a train yard would be fascinating to learn more about. I would interested talking to him about that if he was involved in that at all
It's cool. But...why?
Because fuck making our country better let’s spend 200 million on a pine cone
"I saw this being built and thought it was like 10% complete... turns out it was 80% complete! Lol, art baby"
Dr. Girlfriend we need to get back to the cocoon!
What does it do?
Hudson Yards is a Bloombergian abomination and is a symbol of everything that has gone wrong with NYC. Source: I live here.
"It is an impressive, beautiful structure.  It is a marvel of architecture and engineering."
"Unfortunately, people suck.  It will become a magnet for people with nefarious intent."
nefarious intent.
Walking up and down stairs in an evil way?
It was worse than I anticipated.  Walking up and jumping off.
Looks dystopian and ominous.
Seems like a waste of taxpayer money. How much did this cost again?
It's privately-funded by developer Stephen Ross as part of the Hudson Yards development.

"$200,000,000"
"(Yes, really)"
Its very cool but how long you reckon before people start committing suicide from this thing? I'm guessing a few weeks.
"Some may, but isn't that an argument against any building? It's not taller than the average apartment building, and it's not like those have rashes of suicides. The only places that really have high rates are bridges and cliffs, people want that water to kill them if they survive the fall."
"Buildings have obstacles you have to go through to reach the roof or window. The front door, interaction with people that live in the building, roof access being locked, etc. Most suicides do take place at home, but most people just kill themselves inside. More often than not, jumping suicides occur away from home which means having to go through several obstacles to reach a roof. This structure doesn’t have such obstacles."
"I'm pretty sure modern buildings over a certain height aren't allowed to have windows that can open (and a lot of older buildings, such as ESB are in violation of that code, but nobody wants to modify them)"
This creation has made it too easy.
I reckon you saw this coming.
"What a fun way to absolutely waste $200,000,000"
It’s disgusting
at least you see and Can enjoy this place. Unlike everywhere else my tax money goes.
"if your shit looks like this, sell it! It’s art!"
