Yeah I’m not sold on this as an ‘iconic monument’ yet
I’m really surprised about the hate on this. If you happen to think it’s ugly it only effects the 100 yards around it. It’s lot like it’s 432 park ugly and ruining the skyline for miles.
The rich companies paid for a public park open to everybody. Before this was here it was a pit in the ground for an entire century. The complaints sound like immature adolescent mewling.
This is rich.
The rich companies that developed this land did it with unprecedented local and state help in terms of tax breaks.
"As a PR move, they constructed a small area to both increase the value of their investment and appease the public. The discrepancy between what they received vs. what they gave is appalling. You are very thankful for the scrap."
What should they have given you
local and state help in terms of tax breaks

"Ok. But let’s not act like it’s doing anything that actually advocates for the public. It’s elitist at best in the center of literally the most expensive private development. It’s like the High Line in that it’s not there to serve a majority of actual New Yorkers, it’s a trophy’s"
So true. Would people rather have a football stadium here? I wouldn’t
The outdoor space is lovely. The mall is an abomination.
Could you see a purpose to it?
Not at all. Other than it being a thing to go up to look down
Doing its part to battle America's obesity epidemic.
Unless one takes the elevator!
Can you see a purpose to the Eiffel Tower?
"Yes, it defines it's era and stands prominently in the Paris skyline."
"Are you seriously making an equivalence between the Vessel, a bucket of staircases dwarfed and surrounded by glass and steel skyscrapers, and the Eiffel Tower?"
Why does it define an era?
It was built as a centerpiece for the 1889 World's Fair. At the time it was the tallest man-made structure in the world and represents a triumph of 19th century engineering.
Am I the only person who fears this is just going to be where people in Manhattan go to kill themselves from now on
Nope that idea has been stated whenever a photo of this thing shows up.
Unless it's you in all the other threads?
Uhm.. There's a river across the street from it. This ugly thing would not be the only high point to kill yourself in NY.
"I would definitely choose a bridge or gun over jumping off of this. That way, I wouldn't subject my poor family to having to come visit it every year on the anniversary."
So what? Takes a couple hours to clean up and that’s that
"Can i ask, were you born here? I think most people who were realize that that is a silly suggestion."
That copper is going to be so passé in a year.
"It actually isn't pure copper, but it's a form of copper painted or clad structure."
