Wouldn't it be a challenge to keep all that glass clean?
Same question can apply to just about any big building...
If anything it's easier since there's actually stairs to get up there.
They'd probably use self-cleaning glass.

"It is innovative but his stated reservation that ""it should be something new"" is I think unfortunately still valid. The concept feels new but unexplored. The walkways, landings and created spaces could be fantastical but it's just up and down... and frankly if the design was more interesting, a cafe would not be a bad thing, or areas for art installations, or gardens/vertical gardens/a topiary/aviary etc etc etc. If you're going that far why not go farther?"
"Saw a pretty incredible exhibition on their work at the Cooper-Hewitt last year, made me appreciate their design choices a lot more."
Here's hoping the city doesn't try to shoehorn some retail space into it.
That exhibit blew my mind. Their commitment to their models is so satisfying.
I can't tell if this is parody or reality.
"It seems too short to justify all the steps. I was willing to walk up half of the Eiffel Tower because being surrounded by short buildings the view was worth it. This though, I'm not sure if I'd have the same motivation."
"Also, ADA?"
There will be an elevator.

"Another transient space for a city that's already moving too fast. I'm a huge Heatherwick fan, but I wish he gave us somewhere to relax."
I hope it's not near the financial district
They were 'influenced by images of Indian stepwells' but such a huge part of why those stepwells are so aesthetically pleasing is the lack of handrails/guards.  I like the idea but I think it suffers from the glass guards. Some detail with perforated metal panels or mesh would probably look cleaner and more interesting.  And it would read more as a sculptural object.
Cool.
Nobody's gonna climb that.
I'd love to climb that.
second!
What does the neighborhood think of all this?
I don't think they need an excuse or precedent to do this. I can't wait until I climb that thing. Should be an elevator in the core that takes you all the way up though. Maybe an inner layer of ADA ramps spiraling up? And that reflection on the facade of the far left building....super reach.
Wow. Somebody really likes M.C. Escher. Fuckin cool.
a place where tourists can get thrown from for their purses and cameras.
"The idea is to celebrate the people that visit and it is literally excluding handicapped people. Not like a building, where it may be inconvenient but still purpose of the space is retail, or office, or restaurant, etc... the entire purpose of this structure is ""devoted to celebrating people"" - but only the ones that can walk."
This is a joke right?
"Good lord, some people are handicap and can't enjoy the same things as people who are not.  Not everything on this planet has to accommodate every single living soul.  Some things just ""are."""
"Plus, there's an elevator."
"Lol it's a shitty design plain and simple. Everyone keeps saying ""there's an elevator"". That doesnt mean shit. Ride to the top, ride back down. It's not the same experience. The thing is stupid ass."
Sounds like there's an elevator.
Try to be offended somewhere else.
I'm not offended i just think its a shitty design. It isolates groups. Better architects find ways to include them.
