"Idk I’m still looking forward to seeing this in person. It looks kinda cool. Kind of an eye sore too in some ways lol, but I’m still very curious.

"FAA federally controls airspace, local government does not"
"Yeah it's really weird. All city guidance says drone flying is illegal. No actual laws are cited. Some have said NYPD will nag you for reckless endangerment or something, but it seems unlikely."
Casey Neistat got away with every stunt he’s done
Iirc he got busted at some point and gets permits now?
Less than 400 feet above ground is outside FAA jurisdiction I believe.
