It's been closed for over a year because of this.
Suicide machine.
Cool looking suicide machine.
"I mean, if you gonna off yourself, you might as well do it in style."
Everyone can see to do it too.
"is the designated suicide spot what did you expect, easy to access, easy to jump from, and is getting quite famous. also you get to enjoy a dream-like building (i mean it's something you'll see in one those wierd dreams after a long day work)"
I actually got to go on it before it closed. it was pretty cool.
You alive?
No.
"This seems like a great business opportunity. ""$20 for the lower level, $50 for the top. You won't need this money anyway."""
DuuuuudeðŸ˜­
Wait this isnâ€™t a scene from inception?
Part of the Hudson Yards complex (a gated community without any exterior communal space.) Designed by Heatherwick Studios and called 'Vessel'. Since 2016 four people have used it as a means to kill themselves. There are calls for it to be dismantled.
They are just going to kill them selves some where else.
A similar thing happened in toronto when they put a net over the prince Edward viaduct.
"The viaduct is a very tall bridge right on the subway line near down town.  It has a very low guard rail.  Because it was high,  easy to get to, easy to jump off it was a very popular with people wishing to jump.  The city put a net up so they can no longer jump.  While suicides on a bridge stoped, the suicide rate in the city stayed the same."
All the net does it protect drivers on the highway below from bodies.
"Studies show that when suicide means are more difficult, suicide drops. The most famous case study was when gas stoves in the UK were the most popular method of suicide, because you could turn the gas on, not ignite it, and just inhale till you die."
"Then safety measures were implemented to make this impossible to do. Youâ€™d think, if you were right, that people would just find another way to kill themselves, right?"
Wrong. Suicide rates plummeted.

Its a very sad but nice song
Exactly. Suiciders will find a place regardless

"Colossal design oversight which shows how closely our environment is related to each of our lives, as well as a mirror revealing the general well-being of the public at large in our time. As an architect myself, this smells of the same critical lack of class awareness which has caused many of our evolving urban planning deficits. People look up at the giant expensive stairway to nowhere and they feel incredibly small and insignificant. They see a world that doesn't care nor have a place for them. They see hidden cogs of an economic engine completely content to churn them into grease for the axle of greed on which we are all forced to collectively place our hopes for a better future."
Ask A Mortician recently made a video about it.

Open it up.
What did you expect?
"it's cool looking, but what's the point? it's like some rich guy was trying to figure out what to do with his money and he was all, ""you know what i like in a building? stairs. make me a building that's just stairs!"""
"The point is to look cool. It's an art piece, not meant to be a functional building."
money. people are addicted to selfies. they literally built a staircase to nowhere to charge people $50 so they can take selfies.
"I believe they then got sued for making it inaccessible to wheelchair users. And so added an elevator, which still limits access to the short stretch of balconies serviced."
Yeah its just an obnoxious flex to prove that they could build it
"And I hear about it from this subreddit like once a week, they closed it, so stop posting about it please!"
If your not familiar look up High Place Phenomenon.
Thatâ€™s not the same thing as an epidemic of mental health issues and lack of healthcare support causing suicide.
"Didnâ€™t say it was, but it happens and maybe someone hadnâ€™t heard about it."
I blame Peloton.
And Obama.
"Well if you have to do it, this seems to be about the most interesting spot. Looks like a damn X Games event takes place here or something"
It's all super sad.
