"im not sure if this has been pointed out yet or not, but it‚Äôs infamous for being a place where multiple people have committed suicide. it was perfect to have in that scene imo"
"That whole area is just a desolate wasteland of empty industrial lots turned into multi-million dollar new construction condos for the ultra wealthy to park their money and then never actually set foot in. Possibly the most soulless neighborhood in all of New York-- outwardly opulent and desirable, sure, but completely manufactured and hollow on the inside. Absolutely makes sense that that's where Kendall's place would beü•≤"
"This is very true. I am an owners rep and my Boss and I went to one of the Hudson Yards high rises to inspect a $2M one bedroom apartment on the 67th floor.

That entire area is so strange ALL THE TIME as it is as deprived of people as the buildings are tall."
"Great backdrop for this show, especially Kendalls apartment"

We see the vessel a few times in the episode. But its not until the end we see that Ken's apartment is right over the vessel. I just really excited to tell my friend about this, but its such a great detail that you might not get if you don't live in the NYC metro area."
