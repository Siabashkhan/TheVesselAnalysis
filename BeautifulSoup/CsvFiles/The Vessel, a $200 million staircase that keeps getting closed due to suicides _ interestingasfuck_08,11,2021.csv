Or just have a designated suicide part. Call it the SuiSide.
Eventually people will avoid it due to the smell.
I would regret suicidal thoughts even having the idea of landing on a pile of corpses and end up alive but painfuly stabbed with other's bones and dying painfully weeks after of sepsis at the hospital.

Might ruin the aesthetic but yeah it would definitely reduce suicides you'd think.

"Hear hear! I had a video store guy tell me if I liked Pi then I would also like Cube. He was wrong, but he also wasn't wrong."
"I was going to say monofilament wires, but piano wire works, too."
it will only  shift suicide to somewhere else !
trust me    i live not too far from the second most suicidal bridge in north american after the famous golden gate !
"It wouldn't reduce suicide at all, it would just make them do it in a more convenient fashion."
It turns out adding barriers to specific methods of suicide is actually quite effective at reducing overall suicide rates.
"""In England, death by asphyxiation from breathing oven fumes had accounted for roughly half of all suicides up until the 1970s, when Britain began converting ovens from coal gas, which contains lots of carbon monoxide, to natural gas, which has almost none. During that time, suicides plummeted roughly 30 percent ‚Äî and the numbers haven't changed since."""
We‚Äôre solving the wrong problem here guys
The beatings will continue until morale improves
"I know suicide nets have been done before, I can‚Äôt recall where though."

Honestly they should just put a net there and start charging bungie tickets

"Or, you know, just provide people with universal healthcare and a social safety net in one of the world's richest countries & cities..."

They already spent $200 million on stairs. No more money for healthcare.
"What a WILD and IMMORAL concept. How dare you? People need to EARN (or be given) money in order to take care of themselves. If you aren‚Äôt born with wealth, well then you deserve death babes!"
Canada has both of those and people still kill themselves every day.
Canada's suicide rate is 30% lower than the US.
From the amount of people with mental illness now you would need 10% of all people to be therapists.
Nobody needs downvote bots pulling hyperbolic numbers out of their ass. You're not helping.
"Universal healthcare includes mental health, Creampuff. And I can tell you from experience that a social safety net can be the thin layer help between depression and suicide. Depression isn't exactly solvable, but it's not terminal, either. Access to counseling and/or medication is key for many, many people. If you prefer data - the US, known the world over for it's broken healthcare system and lackluster social safety net - has some of the highest suicide rates in the wester/euro-centric world. Literally twice as high as the UK - an undisputedly depressing place."
We can do better.
"Hence what Universal healthcare implies and what a social safety net means. American healthcare is a joke and doesn't really count for anything. Often, situations like yours just exacerbate the issue for many."
Yikes. What an embarrassing thing to say.
"Of course netting is a bandaid solution that will work... that will do nothing to address the underlying issues. Of course not everyone uses one service or another, but that's why we have different ways of approaching problems. What are you even trying to prove?"
Ah yes. Universal Healthcare. That will help after successful suicide.
"I hope you get the help you need, elf."

"There was a guy maybe like 12ish years back who decided to do himself at Niagara Falls.  It was late winter / early spring and there chunks of ice the size of cars flowing over the falls.  Guy jumps in above the falls and goes over.  People called 911 immediately.  Somehow he managed not to drown or get crushed, but it took like 20 minutes or more for a helicopter to spot the guy a good way down river, in near freezing water littered with massive ice chunks.  So the helicopter approaches the guy and throw out a heaving line.  I believe it was a tour company chopper, not like military search and rescue with swimmers and baskets etc.  The guy kept swimming away from them.  Eventually the fire department guys got some kind of watercraft out there, and fished him out, alive."
"It inspired me to write a song which I did.  It was called ""He swam away"".  That's all I remember, or perhaps all I want to.  Pretty dark shit, but what fascinated me aside from the incredible fact that the guy lived at all, was 1) you're in such a low place that you decide to end it, in what seems like a horrific but pretty surefire manner, and then you even fail at that, and 2) you somehow survive all that shit, and then refuse help 20 minutes later, but you still keep swimming in freezing, violent water...  like wtf!?"
Maybe he was just out for a swim
Didn't wanna pay for the medivac
"Shoulda just swam underwater the whole time as soon as he got down the falls, either he'd pass out and drown or just drown"

I've never understood the point of a suicide net
Surely you can crawl to the edge and jump again?
Suicide prevention researcher here.
"Most suicides are impulsive, quick decisions to make an attempt to die. The crisis is time-limited and most people with suicidal thoughts, or even who make attempts, don't die by suicide. If you stop someone once, they usually won't make another attempt. They don't usually switch to another means if their go-to method is taken away. People who want to shoot selves don't Open up their veins if they can't buy a gun. The woman who wants to jump off the bridge isn't going to step out into traffic if she sees the net."
"A fear of pain is a huge barrier to people trying to kill themselves. It's why there aren't a lot of completed  suicides with knives or self-immolation. A metal net, like they are building under the golden gate bridge is supposed to hurt like hell to land on. And hard to climb out of. If people know they are going to get hurt AND aren't going to die, then they probably won't make an attempt. Landing in a net will also usually give the person a chance to rethink whether they actually want to die. Most attempters do not. There is some other goal."
"So that is the theory anyway with anacdotal support. It ""feels"" like the right answer. There is not a lot of good data to say whether they actually save lives or reduce suicide rates."
"That said, for an individual you are concerned about, help them come up with a plan to put time and space between very dangerous items they could use to attempt suicide (firearms, poisons). You can call the national crisis line and ask for advice. 800-273-8255"

Can confirm.
"When I was 19 I tried to kill myself by ODing on, of all things, my antidepressant medication (they were tricyclic, the modern, safe ones weren't working. I guess these weren't working either)."
"Anyway, it wasn't a cry for help, I told no one I was planning it for fear they'd stop me, I pretended to be totally normal. Almost immediately after swallowing a whole bottle I realised I had blown everything completely out of proportion and I really really did not want to die. I began crying uncontrollably and told my boyfriend what I'd done."
"I don't remember much else until I woke up in hospital with IV bruises on my hands, elbows, and feet, and random charcoal stains everywhere. Apparently I was in a coma for a while but luckily I survived. My mother still thinks I wasn't serious and was doing it for attention. Comas are so cool, dontchoono."
"I've tried other antidepressants in the 20 odd years since but nothing has worked. Luckily the clarity I gained that day has never left me and I've never tried again. I don't think I ever will, either."
my mom thought the same. it hurts to much for her to accept the truth about what happened.
I'm sorry your mum feels that way.
"With my mum, I think it was more about avoiding responsibility for any actions that may have contributed to my mental health."
"Nothing is ever her fault and since she was a single parent, well there weren't many other people to blame, therefore it wasn't serious and doesn't matter."
"I can literally count on one hand the number of times I've heard her apologise. To anyone, not just me."
"My sister recently apologised to me for how she has treated me in the past. She said she let mum's bad opinion of me cloud her own judgement but slowly, and especially since mum went into a home a few years ago, she can see me for who I really am. I'm still processing this one. I knew she played us off against each other, I just didn't realise the degree to which she did it, even as adults."
"This sounds like my mom too. I had to look at the situation with a whole new perspective so i could find another meaning for her reaction. Yes, its never their fault, but what‚Äôs the reason of that, you know?"
"My episode completed three years last may. It took a lot of therapy to forgive myself, and then look at other‚Äôs reactions with a little less victimism (this is not at all me saying that‚Äôs your case)."
"I lost friends that never came back. I‚Äôve tried many ways to reborn that friendship. I learn that it was just too much for them. Doesn‚Äôt mean they don‚Äôt love me anymore, it only means that the episode hurt them enough to the point of not being able to stick around."
"And in our mom‚Äôs case, they have to stick around."
"You did better than me, it took me another 8 years and getting sober before I dealt with my issues."
"My Mum was a very damaged woman from an abusive home, and she spent her life jumping from frying pan to fire to try to escape bad situations."
"Her parents could admit no wrong either, so maybe it's a learned behaviour, or possibly the ego protecting self-image. All I know is that when both her and her brother had a discussion with their mum about their childhoods and her total inability to protect them. Her mum made excuse after excuse, and when those were rebuffed, she just sat there and cried, saying nothing. To realise how grievously she failed them you have to know that the one time grandad hit her, even though they were married and it was the 1940s, she left immediately. She was eventually talked into returning and he never hit her again, but she would tell tales on the kids so he would beat them. They lived in fear of the front gate squeaking, signalling their father's return home."
"I think my mum did her best. She certainly broke the physical abuse cycle, but how can you grow up and form healthy relationships when you were raised in such a household?"
Thanks for sharing.
"No medications have ever worked for my anxiety and depression either. I think it's because they try to treat the symptoms not the cause. I know what caused my anxiety, I know my depression is mostly a symptom of my anxiety. The cause is unresolved though, I don't know how to resolve it because I was hurt at a young age by someone I should inherently be able to trust but they won't acknowledge what they did or apologise so I can't move on."
Around the same time my uncle killed himself so I know first hand what it's like when someone you care about kills themselves. I can't do that to the people I care about but I still have suicidal thoughts. Not because I want to die but because I want this to end and nothing else seems to work.
Your mom's a bitch. Please take care of yourself.
"Thanks and, well, you're not wrong."
"I have mostly forgiven her for everything, but new information pops up sometimes which takes me a while to process."
But she was a very damaged woman from an abusive home who spent her life jumping from frying pan to fire to try and escape bad situations.
"Her parents could admit no wrong either.

"Thank you so, so much for being alive. For being you. For sharing your experience. You have no idea how much it helps other people to know it‚Äôs possible to find a new perspective on the other side, and it‚Äôs not worth doing this to yourself. I‚Äôll remember this post for a while. I used to volunteer at a suicide hotline and friends still ask me ‚Äúhow‚Äù or ‚Äúwhy‚Äù it works. Will show them these answers. Thank you again. Please know you have friends here that would love to get to know you and would be blessed to have you in their lives."
"Your a better person than I, and that sounds like a really fucked up situation. I can't answer that question, sadly. It doesn't give her an excuse to pull shit like that though imo. I guess what happens next is up to you."
"Wow. Yeah. This hits. I tried ODing on my anti depressants and all the pain medication I could get my hands on when I was about 19. As soon as I did it something flicked and I realised I didn't want to die, but I was so tired I just layed down and didn't have the energy to panic."
I did this about midnight one night. Slept the next 30 something hours and woke up covered in dried puke. Felt like I had been run over by a steam train. No one even noticed me missing. It made me realise I didn't want to die and I had to help myself if I wanted to change.
"That was about 10 years ago. I've been off antidepressants since, had a lot of ups and downs but I realise now whenever I have those dark thoughts that I need to change something. Nothing matters more then happiness."
I hope you don‚Äôt try again. The world needs you!

"I‚Äôve found that suicidal people don‚Äôt want to die, they just want to stop existing"
They probably went to stop suffering
Stop existing is exactly what dying is‚Ä¶ what they want is escaping their torments/problems‚Ä¶ Source: someone who have dealt with suicide thoughts for ~30 years
Pain.
"Torments, problems, it's all words for pain."
"It isn‚Äôt to everyone, especially religious people, but I understand what you mean. What I meant by my original comment is essentially what you‚Äôre saying, I know it all too well as well"
"Exactly. You don‚Äôt want to die or need any attention, it‚Äôs just a wish out of existence."
"I think the ""stop existing"" means wishing they wouldn't be born at all. I have had ""suicidal thoughts"" before, but i was too afraid and scared to just jump off a building or to cut myself. What i wanted was to just not exist. I wished that id just never been born at all."
Edit: ‚òùThat was a totally unintentional bohemian rhapsody reference
"Paraphrased, but I read in a book: The people jumping out of an apartment building on fire, aren't not afraid of jumping, falling, or dying from that, they're just more afraid of burning in the fire...Now imagine that burning fire is in your head."
"The book also had a (albeit fictional) person say what you said: they don't want to die, and if they could choose a coma over death they would. Just go to sleep for a while and not feel anything."
"This is an interesting analogy. To people struggling with suicidal thoughts, often they may feel the problem now is worse than the consequences of whatever they do to try to stop it."
"This, I used to want to go to sleep and not wake, but not die."
Yeah exactly
I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve felt that way. I know how much pain it takes to feel that way.
"It‚Äôs ok, doing much better than I used to for the most part. Long term antidepressants have been a shit show for me that‚Äôs made me worse 95% of the time, highly recommend to any and everyone suicidal to at least consider ketamine infusions if they have the money for it, hope you‚Äôre doing better friend"
"I am in this paradox now i live in a tranquilized existence,  no amount of sedated deep no dreaming sleep can prepare me for my alarm clock and the monotony that follows day in day out"

Indeed you are
Yup
I recall reading that a certain state or country started using blister packs for medication and suicide rates went down with the medication because it took time to pop each pill out of the package. Don't remember the medication but it backs up what you're saying about the impulse.

Personal notes:
""
The switch from coal gas to natural gas for domestic use in Brirish homes left the suicide rates in the 70s were down by a 1/3 on that in the 60s. The convenient and painless death method had been removed from the house.
"Britain converted their ovens from coal gas (which has lots of carbon monoxide) to natural gas in the 70's - and suicide rates permanently dropped by a third.  Until then, about half of their suicides were from people breathing oven fumes - turns out removing the suicide machines from peoples' kitchens was a very effective preventative measure."
"Yes. It's a great example of the benefits of taking away easy methods of suicide. It won't stop every single person, but it prevented so many deaths."
"The time period question is a good one. Short answer: for most, minutes to less than an hour. So very impulsive."
"The Houston study interviewed 153 survivors of nearly-lethal suicide attempts, ages 13-34. Survivors of these attempts were thought to be more like suicide completers due to the medical severity of their injuries or the lethality of the methods used. They were asked: ‚ÄúHow much time passed between the time you decided to complete suicide and when you actually attempted suicide?‚Äù One in four deliberated for less than 5 minutes!  (Simon 2005)."
Duration of Suicidal Deliberation:
24% said less than 5 minutes
24% said 5-19 minutes
23% said 20 minutes to 1 hour
16% said 2-8 hours
13% said 1 or more days
https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/duration/
""
"To your second question, I don't know, but I would suspect yet. People often act on other impulsive and fleeting thoughts. Especially true when people are intoxicated. Think about the things you've done when you've been drunk that seemed like a great idea but you would have never done sober. By ""you"" I mean ""me""."
Many people who died by suicide had alcohol or drugs in their system.
""
"A lot of the ""warning behaviors"": giving stuff away, preparing a will, talking about death, changes in mood (better and worse); are giving an indication that the person is spiraling downward and COULD be at risk for suicide. there are less than 50,000 suicides in America each year and there are tens of millions of people struggling with a mental illness or substance use problem. So there are a lot of people who display all of the warning signs but don't complete suicide."
"And it is easy to look at the life of a person who completed suicide and identify clear warning signs. But no one has a complete picture in the moment. If you notice warning signs in realtime, what that should clue you into is that the person is certainly at risk of completing suicide at some time."
Even experts can't predict who will complete suicide and when. Rather they talk about people having elevated risks of suicide when compared to other people with similar demographics (usually age and gender).
""
"Some people talk about the gun being loaded by preexisting risk factors and then a stressor or crisis pulling the trigger. I think its kind of a morbid analogy, but makes sense to me. There usually is a ""last straw"" that overwhelms the ability to cope any more."
""
Throughout this thread people have mentioned some different things that can help reduce the risk of a deadly suicide attempt.
"Nets under bridges where there are a lot of suicides. It will reduce deaths certainly, but also reduce the number of people trying as they expect their attempt not to succeed. Blister packs for pills. It takes a lot longer to get together a deadly amount of pills, giving people time to decide to live. Reducing access to firearms and ammo for people at risk. Making a plan for someone else to hold the guns of a person at risk of suicide; locking up all the guns and ammo in the house of a teenager with suicidal thoughts. Providing crisis resources can be helpful too. Those signs on bridges with the crisis line gives the person another chance to see that help is available and then go and get it."
""
"There's a documentary about people jumping from the Golden Gate called ""The Bridge"" where a researcher filmed The Bridge from a distance with a fixed camera for a year and caught numerous suicides on camera."
"He interviews one guy who jumped & lived and the jumper basically says: ""As soon as I let go of the bridge, I knew everything that made me want to kill myself was fixable."""
Quotes from two Golden Gate Bridge suicide attempt survivors:
"""The millisecond my legs cleared it, the millisecond of true free fall, instant regret for my actions,"" said Kevin."
"Ken had a startlingly similar experience: ""I just vaulted over, and I realized, at that moment, this is the stupidest thing I could have done. Everything could have changed."""

Hell of a read. Thanks for linking.
Having attempted suicide myself and been stopped in the process I can confirm that you‚Äôre right. Once I was interrupted I didn‚Äôt return to my attempt.

Well in this instance it was my dog who stopped me. Some people say I‚Äôm too affectionate and cuddly with my dog now but they don‚Äôt know the reason why.
I don't think there is such a thing as being too affectionate and cuddly with a dog. Glad you buddy was there for you when you needed him/her
""
"When my father completed suicide, he waited until all of us were out of town and unplugged his phone so no one was there to stop him. He really felt he had no way out. Very sad that he was hurting that much. And a very terrible thing to do to our family."
"That's pretty interesting! speaking from my own experience too, no one really wants to die. People who seek this as a last resort are usually those who see no other escape from their situation or what they're going through, have hit so low that they don't even see how things could ever get better for them, and this is one of the ways to stop suffering."
"Please look for medical advise from other specialists, lot of psy conditions which cause depression can be worsened by antidepressants, bipolar disorder for e.g."
Disclaimer: I do not work in medical/psy field but I somehow know it
"oh no I'm way past that thankfully, still dealing with some traumas here and there but in a better place now :)"

Thank you for being brave enough to save a life.
Research on Golden Gate Bridge suicide attempt survivors found 90% did not die later by suicide. Those are good odds.
"Of the 515 people whose attempt was interrupted, only 35 later died by suicide in the years to come.  Taking into account suicides that might have been missed by researchers,  Dr. Seiden stated that 90% of people who tried to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge did not go on to die by suicide."
https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2013/07/05/suicide-attempt-survivors/
i can attest to this. i was suicidal once long ago. i was extremely exhausted and miserable but the flip side of it was that i had no easily available method of death on hand and i fell asleep before i could come up with something more involved. fortunately when i woke up i had more perspective

its been years. i havent been suicidal in a loooong time
"These are some really sad stories. I knew New Zealand had high youth suicides, but didn't know why."
"It makes me so angry that in the UK you have to hit a threshold for getting help, and the children‚Äôs mental health service is especially adamant that you‚Äôre not ‚Äòserious‚Äô about committing suicide unless you‚Äôve made a plan or written a note. It‚Äôs utter bullshit. I‚Äôm trying to get help for my kid, his assessment is tomorrow. I expect they will once again turn him away because he hasn‚Äôt got a specific plan and hasn‚Äôt written a note, but we know from past experience in the moment he will absolutely try it on an impulse."
The system here is so horribly broken. It‚Äôs criminal how they can get away with this.

"Thank you, I just saw this (I get anxious about notifications), I‚Äôm happy to say they seem to be finally taking us seriously and my child was able to get a referral for a full mental health assessment with a psychiatrist. So hopefully it‚Äôs the start of the right support. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

my sister is an ER nurse. a guy came in with severe neck lacerations. he admitted it was a suicide attempt. problem is he lay on a bed with his head tilted back. the doctor explained to him that when you extend your neck backwards the tendons and muscles come to the forefront and it is very hard to cut into the arteries. if you want to cut through the jugular you need to lean your head forward.
the guy did a 90 day stay in the psych ward. soon afterward he showed up in the morgue with his throat cut the proper way.
grim story but... some people are determined to die.

something to keep in mind if youre ever in a crisis.
tomorrow is another day.
"Wish they had put a net around my wife. Alas, I didn‚Äôt get the chance to think twice"
I am sorry.
My son changed his method for his second suicide attempt and it was lethal. Some people do switch to a different method. I say this so people won‚Äôt be lulled into a false sense of security/relief thinking they have limited the person‚Äôs access to lethal means based only on previous attempt choices. It‚Äôs recommended that you reduce/limit access to all lethal means.

"I am sorry. That is very sad. The loss of a family member to suicide is so hard (it was for me, at least)."
""
""
"If the Vessel became free, and more people were around on the vessel would that still prompt the person to re-evaluate their attempt to commit suicide since there are more people around that would prevent it from happening???"
""
"On the other hand, there are folks who will. Read about Yukio Shige, a retired police officer in Japan who patrolled the ""suicide cliffs"" and saved hundreds of people."
https://www.latimes.com/world/asia/la-fg-japan-suicide-20180222-story.html
"I think the assumption is that landing in a suicide net shocks you into reality. Most barriers to suicide are pretty effective because on an instinctive level your body really doesn't want to kill itself. The goal isn't to make suicide impossible, just to make sure it's never convenient, especially on an impulse."
"And if someone's truly dedicated to committing suicide, almost nothing can stop them."
"To your last point, very few people are truly dedicated to wanting to kill themselves. And it is really hard to stop them. They have to stop themselves"
"‚ÄúA naked person in a padded room can still kill himself, so the fact that you haven‚Äôt tells me that you want to keep living. At least a little.‚Äù"
"-My psychiatrist, a long time ago"
wise.
So a view from half way down kinda thing
"yes, an ""oh shit, i shouldn't have done this"" realization comes too late for many."
Here is an interview with a Golden Gate Bridge suicide attempt survivor
https://www.wect.com/2020/11/17/it-was-instant-regret-golden-gate-bridge-suicide-survivor-share-story-virtual-event-wilmington/
"‚ÄúThe millisecond my hands left the rail, it was instant regret for my actions,"" Hines says."
"if someone's truly dedicated to committing suicide, almost nothing can stop them."
Supermax cells are designed to insure the occupants have no means of suicide or murder. You will live a long life alone in a simple gray box with nothing to do for 23 hours a day. That's a helluva deterrent or so you'd think
That's a helluva deterrent
I view that as a helluva suicide incentive rather than deterrent.
"Exactly, I would not want to live that way. That's when teeth become weapons and you rip out veins."
I've heard it's common for people to have regrets as they fall. Maybe the nets are a second chance for some.?
""
Except a bullet.
A lot of people who jump do so and regret it mid air. We only know due the small amount of survivors.
This reminds me of a poem from Bojack Horseman. I always found it very beautiful but profoundly sad:

"I also listened to a podcast from a man who survived a crazy high jump, and he said halfway through he realized he just wanted to be back at the top."
"Yup. That has saved me a few times. Not even exaggerating, I had picked the bridge and chosen a date, then I got to that episode and couldn‚Äôt go through with it."
Glad you didn‚Äôt. Hope you‚Äôre doing better these days‚Ä¶.its tough I know.
"Sounds like a I need to finally give Bojack a shot, I‚Äôve kind of always ignored but have heard its pretty great."
"It really is, it‚Äôs entertaining and helped me get help."
I‚Äôm happy you‚Äôre here.
Although I‚Äôve never had suicidal thoughts I have thought about what it would be like and why I‚Äôve never seriously contemplated it. Eventhough I‚Äôve had times where I didn‚Äôt see the light at the end of the tunnel.
I think I want to feel like I‚Äôll always be in control. That‚Äôs why I never want to kill myself. Because the thought of losing control over whether I‚Äôll live or die scares me. Once my feet leave the bridge I won‚Äôt have a choice and that scares me.
But death is unescapable. One day I won‚Äôt have a choice anymore anyways. I hope when that day comes I‚Äôll be completely okay with it.
"I guess suicide at least gives you some control on when to opt out. When you feel like nothing could make things better, suicide gives you a way to leave all your worries behind. So I get the appeal. But when your feet leave to overpass all those worries that clouded your judgment seem so trivial suddenly. You‚Äôre suddenly fighting for your live but you have no power. You‚Äôve made your last and worst choice."
Is that lack of control something that scares you?
"In a way, but I‚Äôve reached points where I either thought others would be happier if I was dead, or life just felt too hard, its often less about dying, and more about not living."
"Indeed, beautiful and sad. Thanks for sharing."
wow.
About 2/3 of the way down they usually change their minds yeah.
"I went bungee jumping, and upon leaping into the air I was paralyzed with regret and fear. The fact that there was a bungee attached to me wasn't registering - the only thought I was able to have was that I just completely fucked up and now I'm going to die and I wish I hadn't done what I just did."
The second time I jumped was much more enjoyable.
"Yes, I watched a video about a guy who survived jumping from the golden gate bridge. Even though he'd been depressed since forever, he said that the split second he left the bridge he knew it was a huge mistake."
It‚Äôs a terrifying thought.
Few people realize that it‚Äôs really difficult to successfully commit suicide‚Ä¶ most of the time you survive with more (health for e.g.) problems that you had before‚Ä¶
With shooting yourself and jumping it‚Äôs different
"Check by yourself‚Ä¶ lot of people have failed it even with those methods, finishing with half blown face or para/tetraplegic. Even the ¬´¬†successful¬†¬ª suicide attempts results in lot more pain and agony that the victim (and they are, when you commit suicide, most of the time it‚Äôs because the chemical balance of your brain is deficient. We are hard coded to self preservation, not to harm ourself‚Ä¶ mental illness, peer pressure, etc‚Ä¶ are what trigger suicide, nobody having a happy life wake up one day thinking ¬´¬†fuck this life, I‚Äôm over with that¬†¬ª) was expecting."
"Not saying it‚Äôs impossible, just saying the rates of survival are lower than something like overdose or slitting your wrists"
"You are probably right, but please if you read this and think about harm yourself, please search help, depression is a hell of a situation which prevent you to take any good decisions, but trust me, there are solutions‚Ä¶ please allow others to help you to find it. I know so many people which got help and are so more happy now."
One person who survived I believe said that on this film.
I feel silly now but I've never once considered the idea of someone landing in a suicide net and simply crawling off again. It's like something straight out of a Monty Python skit.
Surely you can crawl to the edge and jump again?
""
"Usually theyre pretty close to the ground so the fall is gonna turn from 40-100 meters to 20meters, which just breaks your bones"
"People have died from falling just from their standing height to the floor and landing wrong, it never ceases to strike me as the universe being particularly cruel for someone to jump off a building and live."
"(To clarify this is not a critique or an attack on you, more of a general observation.)"
You know what's funny? This was the first thought I had.
Clicked back and kept on browsing and then I realized how absolutely fucking insane it is that it's our first reaction to this.
"Instead of being like, ""Why are people doing it, and how can we help them?"" it's just, ""Put up some fucking nets to catch them, then send them on their way and move on."". I'm sure they probably get some BS interview about it and then booted back to their life after the examination but the effect is the same."
"We have such an ass-backwards way of looking at mental health as a species that it's sometimes hard to wrap your brain around or even understand how we got here. We have such a reverence for the brain and all the amazing things it can do, yet when it comes to admitting or fixing the many problems with it we avoid it like the plague."
We're so bizarre.
"My bad, I forgot we can't make general statements without being hammered by the literal-ity police."
"And by we, in this context, I mean me just so you aren't confused or offended by my statement. Although I suppose ""we"" could be proper because I'm sure I'm not the only person you've yelled at for this. But I'll limit my observations from now on to only myself so I never accidentally sound like I'm speaking for more than my singular, individual personage."
"Well if you aren‚Äôt willing to get help for yourself, then who the fuck is suppose to get it for you?"
The irony of this response is almost too unbelievable.
Elaborate
"When you are on the verge of killing yourself, your brain isn't functionning logically anymore. Our natural instinct is to get away from anything painful and dangerous, so you must understand that if a person persuades themselves to the point where they are taking actions against their lives then their brain is already heavily affected by chemical imbalances. Then, you can't expect at that moment from them to seek help. They are literally unable of it."
""
You‚Äôre missing the point. Before they get to that precipice they surely have already been having suicidal thoughts. My point was that if they doin‚Äôt seek help before they get to that crossroads then how is anybody else suppose to get help for them? Read their minds? It‚Äôs not a reasonable request to ask of other people.
"Asking for help can be impossible for some people though, especially if your in a depressive feedback loop where your brain has convinced you that nobody in your life gives a shit about you, why would you ask those assholes for help? Add any kind of self medication into the mix like alcohol, and you get thesuicides where people don‚Äôt even leave a note for those their leaving behind, it just needs to funking end, ASAP. That‚Äôs where I was at the beginning of 2020. I live in a country where the medical system didn‚Äôt just throw me under a bus and then drain my life savings for the privilege, and after 3 weeks in a psych ward, I was allowed to go home."
"There is so many reasons for why someone in mental distress wouldn't seek help that your point is not standing up. I think you don't mean to be rude or anything. You just have to accept that anyone in this mental situation is already trapped on a dangerous road. I can only speek for myself, but I've read so many other stories about that, I'm pretty sure it's a last-resort brain mechanism. Sure, at first you feel a bit sad, or angry, or anything. And slowly it gets stronger. But, it's not like a disease where someday you wake up and you have blood coming out of your nose. It grows silently inside of you, to the point where it silences you. Some people also don't have the chance to live in safe environments, and trying to talk about their mental health to their social relatives can sometimes put them in more immediate danger than keeping it for themselves. Please understand that every situation is different, and an appropriate help have to be given accordingly to the particular situation."
""
"There's more attempts to help depressed people nowadays than a century ago, that is true. But it is not a good reference, considering how insignificant it was considered at the time. From most of human history, suicide was either considered as honorific, or a weakness demonstration. And in many countries in the world it hasnt changed. Your words can be very hurtful for those who, deeply, want to seek help, because they value their lifes as any human being, but just can't, because of their situation, or the state of their mental health. You can't expect from a dehydrated person alone in a desert to magically find an oasis with nice people. And sometimes, you don't even know that you entered the desert that it's already too late, and you drink your last water without precaution because, rightfully so, you don't know it is the last time you will have water in your possession."
""
"My, and the person I was responding to, first response was to be like ""Just hang some nets and done."" which upon further reflection felt kinda callous and empty. Why don't we default to the idea of why are people doing it and how can we make it so that they don't feel like they have to? I.E. how do we help these people?"
Your comment is pretty much the poster child of thought that in my estimation has kinda led us here. An example -
"I worked with a guy who I debated all kinds of topics with while at work, it kept us entertained. On many occasions we'd debate controversial topics and during a news cycle about a girl who convinced her boyfriend to kill himself we ended up talking about suicide and whether or not she should be charged with murder."
""
"I understood the argument he was making, although I vehemently disagreed with it but at its core what struck me was the almost unbelievable level of cruelty in that thought process."
"""If I can do it, anyone can and fuck anyone who can't."""
"Your response bears a similar sort of thought at its core. That everyone, regardless of circumstance or challenge should be able to successfully advocate for themselves."
"It belies a painfully deep misunderstanding of what faces some people in their lives, often circumstances well out of their control and sometimes their understanding."
"And if they're unable to overcome that... well, I guess fuck them, right?"
""
This cracked me up
"Because if the nets work too well, it becomes an attraction for those into extreme sports."
Ya just buy the ones made by Foxconn
Nets on every level and every side....

"Barenaked Ladies talk about suicide nets in one of their songs - War On Drugs - it's pretty bleak compared to most of their material, but it's a solid effort, IMHO."
People would just jump into the nets for S&G's
"They would have to put nets on every side of the tower and in the middle, not fun"
That's the spirit.
Too*
What if they added a diving board?
"A Batman comic once explained the emblem on his chest as ""something enemies can aim at"" but had body armor underneath. Better than risking a shot in the head."
"A diving board may attract the attention of the suicide prone, and reduce the need for huge safety nets."
I‚Äôll try to hit the center
I have no intention of taking my own life.
"But if I ever did, this is where I'd go."
It's not really a good spot.
You really want a spot where you know you aren't gonna land on someone else.

Rule 1 of brutalism (and also rules 2-10) are that you need exposed concrete. This thing is made of steel and copper.
They should have security guards shoot people trying to jump off.
"Ok, now i just need to find out where it is and wait until i say to myself ""...yeah, my life is worthless"""
Yeah like you put this up and expect me not to jump off it? That‚Äôs like expecting people not to drive fast on the autobahn.

I forget the word for it (I believe it's french) but it's described as 'call of the void'.
"They're called intrusive thoughts, and they're a symptom of OCD."
"Mayo clinic link here, see under ""obsessions"""
"Before anyone uses this to diagnose themselves, consider that the D in OCD stands for ""disorder"" i.e. something which interferes with your life."
"I get intrusive thoughts. When I'm close to a ledge, I some times think about jumping. I don't want to jump, and I respond by being more careful around ledges. When I'm doing the dishes, I some times imagine dropping a knife on the cat. I don't want to kill my cat, and I respond by being careful with how I handle sharp things. When I am driving, I some times feel like jumping a curb and mowing down pedestrians. I don't want to run anyone over, and I respond by slowing down and becoming better aware of my surroundings."
It's not a disorder because it doesn't have a negative impact. It even has benefits (I hurt myself less and my driving is better). It's more of a quirk.
Invasive thoughts are fucking terrifying.
It's called the 'call of the void' üòä
"I had no idea this was a thing. I thought I was insane. I've always been reluctant to go on building roofs because of a fear that I would mindlessly jump off. I'm not suicidal, so it chills me to think about. Thank you for commenting."
"That's why I'd be too terrified to live in the US. I feel the exact same way, but not only about high buildings, but also about guns. That ""mindlessly jump off"" describes that so well. I never thought others have similar thoughts / impulses. Thank you!"
"As with many psychological phenomenon knowing about it can help you avoid it. Another important one to be aware of is bystander effect. Basically the more people see a problem the less likely each individual is to help, and then nobody will help. It requires somebody to break the social tension to get everybody else to jump in to help"
"Ngl, that smile face is creepy af, Satan."
"At least for me, I felt the call of the void feeling very strongly at the top. My hand barely left s railing, but then again I'm chickenshit when it comes to heights."
Call of the void is how your brains protect you from jumping tho. It‚Äôs to process how the situation would end.
"In numerology, 8 is associated with bad luck and misery. It‚Äôs not something I‚Äôve really people mention much living in Europe, but from the time I‚Äôve spent in Asia it and the number 4 are often regarded as superstitious numbers and avoided."
"Although this place is in New York, and I really don‚Äôt know how popular numerology is in America to be sure if this is what the other person was alluding to."
"In China the number 8 is regarding as good luck and everyone wants anything with numerals to contain 8. It's because 8 sounds like ""prosper/wealth."" People pay extra money for have more 8s in their telephone numbers. It's definitely not avoided, it's the exact opposite."
4 though is avoided since it's a homophone with the Mandarin word for death.
"Yes, while I‚Äôve never been to China I do speak broken Mandarin and I‚Äôve been told BƒÅ is lucky because it sounds similar to the word for wealthy, and I believe it‚Äôs also a lucky number in Japan."
"What I meant, which might not have been clear now I‚Äôm re-reading it, is that from my time in Southeast Asia numerology is at least slightly popular amongst the people I met there, compared nobody in Europe."
"14 is also extremely unlucky in Chinese because it sounds similar to ""is dead"" or ""definitely dead."""
Mista approves this comment.
It's just the highest and one would prefer that for a suicide. But it's also strange that the boy was having a blast and suddenly decided to jump to his death.

"Its a big fear people have when going into recovery, ‚Äúwhat if i feel good enough to do it this time?‚Äù Its a scary thought. Its why good therapy, medication and mindfulness/coping skills are all so important together."

Nope. Kid had a history of suicide attempts. Just regular ol mental health crisis stuff that he learned to mask well enough to be allowed to visit the place. Really tragic stuff.
""
Yeah if someone just randomly chooses to kill themselves they had to have had that thought simmering in the background for a while whether noticed by the outside world or not.
Months or weeks at a time usually. Its really hard to deal with when you get good at masking it.
"Really, the solution is more mental health support rather than just closing this one staircase then. It's really sad to hear that story"
"Check out the work on the concept of ‚Äúsuicide magnets‚Äù, though. Studies have shown that suicidal ideation focuses on a specific plan of action that includes a method and location, and that breaking even trivial elements of that plan can buy the person a moment of reflection that their otherwise pathological impulsivity might never give them. When suicide barriers are erected in places that are known to attract frequent jumpers, for example, nearby high places do not experience an increase in use as alternate method site, as was initially feared. Sometimes the only choice is to close or radically redesign, until the fixations for that place, often based on knowledge of past ‚Äúsuccesses‚Äù, wear off."

I grew up in the generation that didn‚Äôt wear helmets so I may be out of touch with kid‚Äôs psyche these days, but the circumstances seem odd.  Tragic either way."
"I feel like you may be alone in that regard? I would know better from a younger age lol, you don‚Äôt jump off high places is pretty common knowledge. You learn that from jumping off a tree at like 6 years old and twisting your ankle Edit: bruh I thought it was like a 10 year old, 14? That was definitely a suicide"
You‚Äôre probably right.  For some reason I thought he was 10 too.
"Same I actually live a town over from where the kid was from and everyone around here heard about it, was pretty chilling after visiting it myself"
Don't know how the thing looks but maybe it wasn't suicides and people thinking they could drop from one floor of the staircase to the next. I'd think a kid would believe they are able to make that.
"People that have decided on committed suicide are said to be acting happy and stressfree though, so it for sure sounds like suicide. It's also a tourist attraction, so if the parents lifted him over the railing I'm sure someone would have seen that"
The family stated the youth had attempted suicide before
It was suicide there was no accident.  I was literally standing 3-4 feet from the kid when he went over that day.  Guard was talking to us about the structure the kid had his hands on the rail facing away from the center just looking out.  Within a second he was up and over.  Never even looked back as his father yelled for him.
Oh that‚Äôs awful.  Sorry you had to witness that.   That poor family.
Ok random Reddit guy.

"Daaamn. Man kept the receipts, literally."
"I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but that 8th floor.... gives me the heeby geebies"
Why? What's the conspiracy?
"Nothing, but a bunch of people jump off it. I wouldn't blame him for not liking it."
Kid is having fun with his sister and once he gets to the 8th floor he just jumps. Something about that doesnt sit right with me.
Someone make an SCP about this.
"Reminds me of a bridge in the city I live in that goes over the rails and there's usually a few suicides a year on it. They're now doing stuff there, not sure if to reduce the suicides or just structural repairs but I do wonder if places where someone can kill themselves are at fault and to be avoided just because some people wanna die. Like they'd probably find some other place to do it anyways"
"There‚Äôs a bridge in Ithaca, NY just near Cornell University that basically has half an aviary cage of fencing because of the Ivy League students getting poor grades and jumping"
"Troy, not Ithaca, and not ivy league albeit hard as fuck"
"I mean I‚Äôve seen the one in Ithaca before, it didn‚Äôt always look the way it does today and there was only one reason."
"Lmao then its 2 for 2 in upstate new York, thats hilarious"
"Upstate New York will have that effect on you, what a frozen wasteland."
"A kid in my dorm was found at the bottom of the gorge my freshman year. I haven‚Äôt looked at the statistics recently, but around that time there actually were fewer suicides at Cornell than at other ivies but they got more attention because jumping into a gorge is more attention grabbing than OD‚Äôing on pills."
"There's a bridge in Auckland, NZ where I come from called Grafton Bridge. Sadly it was a suicide spot for many years. It now has high glass barriers that slope inwards over the footpath to prevent people taking their own lives. You're right, people can't use this site but it doesn't solve the underlying societal problems that lead to many suicides."
Closing a staircase over 4 suicides in 2 years is pretty extreme. Based on that logic we ought to shut down the Golden Gate Bridge or the Brooklyn Bridge as well.
I don't know if that's a fair comparison since the bridges serve an actual function whereas The Vessel is more or less an art installation.
"I think the main difference is one makes a splash, the other makes a mess."
"also one is a means of getting somewhere for hundreds of thousands of people, while the other is a glorified art project for the rich"
It‚Äôs free admission at certain times of the day though? And it‚Äôs not like the Golden Gate Bridge needs pedestrian access.
Then someone will just drive onto the bridge and get out of their car. All of this shit is just bandaid fixed that don't address the actual problem
Adding barriers to common methods of suicide is actually quite effective at reducing overall suicide rates.
"""In England, death by asphyxiation from breathing oven fumes had accounted for roughly half of all suicides up until the 1970s, when Britain began converting ovens from coal gas, which contains lots of carbon monoxide, to natural gas, which has almost none. During that time, suicides plummeted roughly 30 percent ‚Äî and the numbers haven't changed since."""
That's not to say that we don't need to address the underlying issues that lead to the level of depression where suicide seems like the best way out. But these bandaid fixes do a pretty good job of preventing people from actually ending their lives.
That's actually really nice to know. Thanks!
Ah so we need a moat around The Vessel
Honestly would look really cool
"Let me introduce you to, The Pressure washer, capable of cleaning any surface with it's high pressure water jet. It evaporates any trace of unwanted materials, this includes: moss, grass, humans, rocks, algae and more! It even works underwater!"
"(Not actually tested underwater, tested on my thumb, can confirm it hurts, but it was really clean afterwards. Probably effective against ""splash"")"
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joke
Ofc I know that
Have you?
A human needs to operate the pressure washer so you‚Äôre still needlessly exposing someone to the trauma of cleaning up a body
Hudson Yards is primarily a shopping center for rich people. No one wants to drop thousands at Cartier and then step over a dead body that looks like a smashed watermelon on their way out.

"I feel so bad for the family. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take our son out and spend time with him, show him some love.‚Äù And instead he ends it with you standing there. I mean there had to be red flags that he wasn‚Äôt ok. Why take him to a place that is increasingly becoming known for suicides? Mind boggling"

"I agree with you, while the signs are there, it's not always visible to others, and quite often that's intentional. I still have bouts of depression, and I have a feeling it will be with me for life. I was told I'm manic depressive, which is something that is around forever, but I manage to survive."
""
"If I have any advice for people, don't assume that the signs will be blatant and visible. Sometimes it's a gentle, near invisible cry for help from someone who is positive they are too much of a burden on you to waste your time talking to them about it. Pay close attention to those around you. Be a willing ear, sit and listen, and just be there for the  people close to you, (when you are in a good state of mind of course, and you aren't overburdened with your own problems) It could very well save a life."
I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre still here to tell this story.
"Thank you. For the first time in a very long time, I can say with pride that it feels good to be here. I can't say every day is a cakewalk, I still have very troubled days and nights, but I now feel that I may actually be able survive this. To me, that's huge. It's a hope I didn't have for years, and I have all the people who stood by me and listened when I needed an ear to thank for that. You as well, for not criticizing me like some others just did both in a comment here, and in personal messages. It honestly means a lot to me."
""
"Thank you. I understand that there will always be positive and negative surrounding this topic. A lot of people understand this, and many don't, which is part of why there is such a huge stigma surrounding it. I think that's just how people are, and it's not likely to change any time soon. Honestly, knowing there is support for people like me is enough to tell me that there is hope, and there is a place for me in this world. Thank you for taking the time to listen to my story. It really means a lot to me."
I remember when I went through depression (not got to the point of contemplating suicide but it was still the worst time of my life) I would silently hope that specific people in my life would just ask me if everything is alright. I never got the courage to go up to them to talk about it. But I just hoped that they would. For better or for worse most of them never did.
"And when my mom (which is one of them) did ask me if I'm alright I put on a brave face and said something along the lines of ""Sure. No problem."""
Eventually I did speak to her and it really did help. I can't describe it fully but there is an intense desire to talk to other people yet I was still too ashamed to do it.
It truly is a terrible place to be in and I don't wish it on anyone. I'm glad you decided to talk to your wife and I truly hope that God will bless you with peace.
"Much love,"

"Thank you for sharing that with me. I appreciate that you were comfortable enough to open up to me about a time in your life that had to be among the hardest. I am really glad you managed to pull through it, to talk about it with someone, and that you're doing better now. I wish you the best in the future, and hope it's  filled with happiness and love."
"I am really glad you posted this. I am in a shitty spot rn and going through a lot of thoughts about self harm. I identify a lot with what you posted, I have a lot of self loathing issues and have learned how to wear a mask while I feel absolutely miserable inside. constantly. for decades."
"I still feel like shit, but I appreciate reading about your experience. Its given me some compassion I would never give myself."
"I understand what you're going through. I know that it is hard to open up to others around you, I know it can feel like you're not worth it, but you are. If you can't find the strength in yourself to feel compassion towards yourself, then I will feel it for you. I will tell you the same thing my wife tells me. You are not alone, you are not worthless, you matter. I had to learn over a very long time that these aren't just words, they are a sign that people care, and even if it were just one person that I mattered to, that would be enough. I may not be the world, but to one person, I may be their world, and to me, that's bigger than I could ever imagine. I quit smoking and drinking, and the pride my daughter had for me in those moments was enough to breathe life back into me a thousand times over."
"I don't know you personally, but you took the time to share with me your feelings, and your struggles, and I thank you for that. Sincerely. Admitting we have a problem is the first step towards any kind of recovery, and any kind of real happiness."

I may not always be in the best position to give any advice, but I find often just listening and being supportive can be enough. If not me, then I urge you to find someone you can open up to, someone you trust, it doesn't matter if it's a spouse, a friend, a relative, or a co-worker. Having someone to support you is more helpful than you know. It may just be one person, but it honestly saved my life."

Are you really trolling on a thread about suicide?
Last thing my mom said to me was I‚Äôll go to your funeral after confronting her about her qanon obsession.
Also one extreme red flag is if they're suddenly in a better mood (because they've made up their mind). I have to think almost nobody would recognize that as a danger without being warned beforehand
"A lot of people who kill themselves act happy and peaceful in the days before their suicide. People who were close to them are always surprised because the victim appears happy and full of life, only because they‚Äôre ready to end their suffering the next day. That‚Äôs probably why he was racing up the stairs with his younger sister, appearing mentally well, only to jump. Red flags are often difficult to spot unless you understand this drastic change in behavior, and even then it‚Äôs difficult to spot. It makes me sad to even think about this stuff"
"I‚Äôm sorry for your loss, rest in peace my fellow human"
This isn‚Äôt how suicide attempts pan out for a lot of people. As a survivor myself I hid my struggle from family very well and when it happened they were in total shock. Definitely not surprised the family took him there it‚Äôs a popular attraction and an impressive architectural feat. The same thing happened with the Empire State Building and that‚Äôs why it has a prevention fence now.
Also this landmark isn‚Äôt universally known as a suicide magnet yet though this most recent incident kind of cements it as one.  In fact most actual New Yorkers just became aware of this after the previous third one which received more attention on social media.
"Sadly the kid had attempted suicide before and had a long history of mental illness. It's easy to look back and say ""ok so don't take them to the tall stairs"" but in the moment you'd just be happy that your kid seems to finally be happy."
He had a history of suicide attempts but learned to mask it well enough to be allowed to go.
You don't know anything about depression then. There usually aren't red flags because we hide it from people and pretend to be fine. Please shut up.
"I wanted to say something mean but considering we are talking about depression and suicide I‚Äôm not going to do that. Please be more respectful to people you don‚Äôt agree with. You don‚Äôt know my experience or experiences of people I know, as I don‚Äôt know you. I hope you find peace and happiness."
"I was there back in June. I saw a suicide awareness sign at the bottom steps that had links to resources. I thought to myself, what a weird place to put that sign, and didn‚Äôt think much about it."
"Later, when I was up top and walking around, one of the security guards stopped me and told me I needed to find my group that I came up with because I wasn‚Äôt allowed to be alone. I had no idea people were committing suicide like this."
four suicides in 2 years.
that's it? title made it seems like it happened every week or  month
"If it was anything except suicide, it'd be a classic example of selfish people ruining something nice for everybody."
Makes me think about how much agency is fair to ascribe to people dealing with depression and suicidal ideation.
People committing suicides there did ruin something nice for everybody.
"Yeah, it's the ""selfish"" part some people might have an issue with. Of course they're not thinking about other people in that moment but if it's due to mental illness how much blame is there really to assign?"
"Nobody exists in a vacuum, and we are largely a product of the environment and time in which we were born and grew up. We still need to draw a line somewhere for when we start assigning responsibility."
"We have a term for the ""circle of violence"", but that doesn't mean we never assign the responsibility of not hurting or killing to the people trapped in one, because then it gets hard to assign responsibility for anything."
People really suck. They ruin everything. That place looks like an amazing sightseeing platform and now it's closed because a few people ruined it for everyone else
"Could they not just add a safety net or something? Sure, it doesn¬¥t look that good anymore, but would that not being something worth looking into?"
Making it harder for people to harm themselves because they are in a bad place seems to be a bad idea for you.
"""Dont want to ruin for everyone else."" -- After it was stated the the stairs are closed off."
Yeah or like make the railings higher
It's only 2 years old do it probably does still look that good. We were in NYC in 2018 and it wasn't finished. Was looking at photos of it about a week ago. Glass barriers of an unscaleable height would help.
I was there at the end of July and i don't remember it looking closed (i didn't go in i just saw some people in there). The view from edge was pretty cool tho.
I was there in May and it was definitely open. The article seems pretty new so maybe it‚Äôs recently closed. Sucks cause it‚Äôs a very cool structure.
"Wikipedia says it reopened in may, then someone committed suicide in late July, then it was closed indefinitely."
The last time I was around there they were making people use the buddy system if they wanted to go onto it
I was there last week and it was open. It being closed indefinitely is a rumor I've been hearing for 6 months but I've been there regularly and it's always open.
That's stupid they're going to dismantle it just because a few people have killed themselves from it.
It's just an art decoration?  That's dumb.
This is why we can't have nice things?
What a stupid reason to have to close something so cool.
"That's silly, if people want to jump off, let 'em. Maybe make a spot in the middle that's sectioned off so people who wish to commit suicide can just jump there and not worry about taking someone else out with them."
Wtf no.
4 assholes ruined it for everyone:(
Hey the Bloor viaduct is featured on that article! I've killed myself on that bridge dozens of times.
Is the buddy system why the one guy is being drug there at the top left ?
Twist: they just got lost and needed a way out
Why would they dismantle it? Just don‚Äôt let people on it or build taller fences on the sides.
That sucks. It‚Äôs actually really cool to go up. Glad I got to a couple years ago.
4 in 2 years doesn‚Äôt seem all that bad to be quite honest given how accessible it is
"I'm guessing since it's a crowded area and their bodies land on the floor where everyone can see, it's a bigger deal than people committing suicide on something like the Golden Gate bridge where it's not as visible."
True
"Lame, what a waste"
Aw crap & I didn't even get to go. No more nice views out of the GWB because of the netting.
I think that's a bit dumb and pure correlation because those poor people would have probably suicided anywhere else.
"After the third suicide they added a 'buddy system', no lone people on the staircase."
Wait what if you have no friends? Do you just have to wait for a random stranger?
damn. literally went there like 3 weeks ago. just had to pay like 10 bucks to go up. and they had a security guard every like 10 feet. right outside the shops too. I guess it's a nice place to go out.
"Why close it though, if people are so suicidal they‚Äôre gonna suicide regardless of the conveniently cool looking staircase or not, I doubt closing it lowers the suicide rates or something"
and may be dismantled.
I hope so. Waste of fucking money. Homeless people every single block and they're spending money on this ugly staircase.

Suicide booths.
Its even worse than that. This was closed down because there were 4 suicides in 2 months. The billionaire who built it didn't want to change the aesthetics (for better barriers) so added more security guards and put in a rule in place that you had to be with somebody else to enter. Two weeks ago a 14 year old who was with his family jumped to his death.
Fuck sake. Reminds me of a teen in my area who jumped infront of a train whilst with her mom and sister. Just awful
Honestly it does kind of suck that we have to limit design by making sure it‚Äôs hard for people to commit suicide off it. Clearly we need better mental health resources
"No, we firstly need the world to become not as shitty as it is. There are a lot of reason for depression and suicidal tendencies around. Can't fix that with a pill and a talk."
"a huge number of the world's problems would be solved if people didn't have to worry so much about where to sleep, where to work, where to get food, and where to get healthcare."
"Maybe if we didn't spend 200,000,000 dollars on a staircase that leads nowhere and does nothing and instead used that money for better mental health care for everyone things would be different."
"I don't think ""we"" paid for it. Pretty sure the developer did."
"""We"" as in ""we humans""."
Or just let people commit suicide when they realize how shitty capitalism and their is nothing to do abott it climate change
yeah i‚Äôm sure 14 year olds are killing themselves because of capitalism and not mental health issues
"""did you hear how much Jeff Bezos saved in taxes last year? I can't take this anymore!!"""
"oh right, it's totally that and not the fact that capitalism encourage profit any cost, which cause things like employer pay their workers so little that it's a huge factor in depression, and if they want something better than starving wage, they might be forced into stressful jobs that does not fit them, causing depressions and suicides."
"so why don't we try to limit corporate greed? you don't need to re-invent the wheel when the solution is right in front of you. capitalism is fine, we need better regulations for the ultra-rich and better community resources. I've never heard of a better system than social capitalism and you can look at places like Norway which is one of the happiest in the world and see it working successfully"
"4 suicides in 2 years, not months. For context, the Golden Gate Bridge would have averaged 60 suicides in that time."
The billionaire who built it didn't want to change the aesthetics
"I must have turned into a callous asshole, because I agree with him. Why should he have to? It's a major destination for architects because nothing else like it exists in the world."

Designs get adapted and changed all the time. Imagine building an online service and not wanting to change the design to improve the user experience.
"Like, the main purpose of design in the first place is not the aesthetics, but form that supports function. If it doesn‚Äôt function well, change and adapt. Because watching people die is a terrible user experience."
"I‚Äôm sure architects can come up with an aesthetically pleasing solution that prevents suicides. Otherwise, they‚Äôre not very good architects in the first place."
"You don't understand the Vessel then, and that's fine. I went to it immediately after it opened. Literally the only purpose of that thing is aesthetics - it was always a vanity project. I'm not even really a fan - the money spent on it could have been spent on useful projects instead, but here we are. The experience of it is extremely unique - any suicide prevention add-ons are going to clash with the aesthetics, snide remarks about skill aside."
"14?! What the fuck. What drives a child to jump to a violent end like that, to think that nothing will ever get better and that the only solution is to turn into fucking jam. Very sad."
I had a schoolmate suicide on the last day of school at 14. He was a sufferer of all kinds of abuse and it was easier for him to die than to tell his dad he failed the class.
"There are many other reasons kids make those decisions. Bullying, mental health issues, gender dysphoria, ‚Ä¶"
Very sad indeed.

Have you heard of the Golden Gate Bridge? I've personally witnessed it twice. Once from the bike path on the other side of the roadway (I saw him splash when I looked over my edge. He did not float again.) The other time standing on the shore looking at pelicans. This time the coast guard boat came out after about 15 minutes and started looking for him.
It takes about 3 seconds I'd say.
Math came out to 3.8 seconds if I didn't screw it up. Pretty close
"Hmm, so closer to 4....a bit short... When I used to sky dive I always had this brief moment during free fall, right as I reached to deploy, every single time, this thought ran through my head ""hmm falling feels really nice.... I wouldn't even feel the impact"""
"I believe it is a little longer, most SF Bridge jumpers survive the fall only to break many many bones, limbs not working, they drown in agony"
This thing is not as high as the bridge but concrete is harder than water.
"Not a lot harder, but enough lol"
Super controversial documentary called The Bridge is about this.
"Watch it if you want to feel deeply sad for a day, and a little sad for the week after."
What is controversial about it?
It contains footage of a lot of suicides.
"Oh, figured. Lol. Sorry."
"Was cycling across there once and two body-builder sized uniformed military guys pull up in a golf-buggy with shoulders and assault rifles barely able to squeeze in, to stop someone about to jump, seemed a bit excessive. But a woman talked them down just as they arrived. Didn't even notice we were right next to them."
Law enforcement killing someone to stop them from committing suicide seems very American
Threatening to shoot someone is actually very effective at stopping suicides. They don't want to be killed they want to do it their selves. Yes it makes no sense but so does suicide.
That didn't happen. He made that up.
"Was the next June/July after 9/11. All the airports were still heavily guarded then too. 6 weeks total, spent 4 weeks driving from coast to coast, was good fun."
That does sound accurate all.
What kind of bike did have?
"No clue, it was a rental."

Imagine people not having access to healthcare and throwing 200 mil on a dumb staircase.
After 3 or 4 the architect probably joined them.
Not Thomas Heatherwick. He's a complete egocentric.
Imagine thinking this wasn‚Äôt just a massive waste of someone‚Äôs money
"That's the great thing about buildings in general.  Even if is a 'massive waste of someone's money', most of that money is going to materials, fabrication, engineers, architects, contractors, installers, etc.  It's not a historically significant painting or a bitcoin; that money is actually going to places that support people and are relevant today."
Could it have been spent on something that actually has some feasible use or function?  Sure!  But the money isn't going into a void.
"The money was actually stolen from a program to help low income neighborhoods from what I remember, which is why us New Yorkers hate this piece of shit."
"It was paid for by Hudson Yards developer Related Companies, a private company. So no, it was not stolen from low income neighborhoods."
"Related was able to gerrymander a series of Targeted Employment Areas (TEA) so that the site would qualify as a ""rural"" or ""distressed urban area"" and, in turn, be able to benefit from EB-5 visa applicant investment funds. The EB-5 program is meant to spur investment in underdeveloped areas suffering from high unemployment through immigrants basically ""buying"" visas in the form of capital investment in those areas. I don't think anyone would characterize Hudson Yards as ""rural"", ""distressed"", or suffering from extraordinary unemployment. So even if it was legal, it seems to have violated the spirit of the program."
It should not have been legal. The governing authority should never have allowed it.
"I agree, but unfortunately, New York's Empire State Development Agency allowed this to happen and approved Related's application. (Who knows if they were even complicit in coming up with this scheme, which involved tying underdeveloped Harlem census tracts to Hudson Yards luxury developments)."
"I know we harp on Trump a lot on Reddit, but this was one of the blatant money grabs from his administration and everyone knew it at the time.  They intentionally changed the program administration to make shit like this possible."
It was a federal program? I thought it was at the state level.
"Its both, it's a federal immigration program but States used to decide what the investment areas were (I think they still decide some of them, not sure).  And to be fair, this area couldn't have been developed under Trump, the program's always been famously crooked.  So that was hyperbolic in the first post."
"But Trump changed a bunch of the rules (claiming they were reforming it), including giving DHS compete discretion in designating (at least some of) the investment areas. And, surprise surprise, now that a Trump appointee was in charge of it, a bunch of the new areas included big developments by Trump's allies including.... Jared Kushner.  Kushner's biggest development is in an investment zone and there's no sane argument to call it ""economically distressed"", which is supposed to be how the areas are assigned."
"So yeah, while Trump railed against people gaming the immigration system, he changed the rules to allow his son-in-law to game the immigration system for millions."
It‚Äôs not my fault for doing this because you didn‚Äôt stop me
Hudson Yards was distressed as it covers literal open air train tracks.
"Aka land that wouldn't be available for use without substantial investment to ""deck"" over the train tracks."
Reclaiming space for the city and adding to the tax rolls.
"For the purposes of this visa program, ""distressed"" is defined in terms of an MSA's per capita income and unemployment as opposed to land use or best and highest use of a particular parcel - so from that perspective, the site shouldn't have qualified on its own."
"The West Side Yard is a crucial piece of MTA infrastructure that allows the LIRR to bring millions of riders in and out of NYC - hardly a distressed use of land. 20 years ago, no one would dare build office buildings west of 8th Ave (witness Ogilvy & Mather's controversial move), and the West Side was a broad swath of ""underdeveloped"" land - because there was no demand for it. Only in recent years did we get to a point where it did make crazy financial sense to build billion dollar platforms over active train tracks."
"""This particular TEA snakes up from the West Side and includes Central Park...[T]he qualifying zone for Hudson Yards captures several census tracts in Harlem, where public housing projects boost the overall unemployment figure."""
Fortunately the large percentage of public housing with high unemployment in neighboring areas was able to be used when drawing up the TEA boundaries.
"In essence, completely legal and allowed within the letter of the law here."
"Yeah, as I mentioned in another comment, it's totally legal - technically, they were able to daisychain together a number of census tracts, corner to corner, to make it look like a $28 billion luxury development was functionally and economically directly connected to Harlem. But many still think it breaks the spirit of the law, which is to spur investment in legitimately underdeveloped areas. I think there's a good case to be made whether a publicly subsidized financial services firm office in a tropy high rise directly benefits underdeveloped / underserved communities in Harlem."
you:
completely legal and allowed within the letter of the law here.
defpoints 2 comments up:
"So even if it was legal, it seems to have violated the spirit of the program."
"oh look, you both agree with each other."
"It was distressed in the sense it was an industrial wasteland and largely unused before it was built. That change with what they built, which is clearly not designed for poor people, but the area was pretty derelict before."
It's not really stealing money from poor areas.
"OK, it's not ""stealing"", since it wasn't illegal, but it did redirect money meant for poor areas suffering from low income and underemployment into a $28 billion luxury development that caters to the 1%."
A bunch of rich foreigners invested in this project instead of something else.

"Hmm looks like they took ~$1.6b in funding (of about $25b total) so, relatively, $12.8mm of EB-5 Funding was used for the Vessel. That is dumb. However, idk if we should be so mad at the developers when it's in their best interest to spend the least money as possible. We should be very angry with the government for giving approval for this clearly-not-low-employment area."
"Yes, we can absolutely express anger at a company that works in their own best interests at the expense of the general populace."
"Yeah, I'm so sick of ""A companies job is to make money"" used as an excuse to do shit things."
We need some kind of ethics code built into regulations for all companies. JFK.
JFK
John F***ing Kennedy?
The rest of us developed countries call that ‚Äúgovernment regulation‚Äù.
"""Haha oops we killed a bunch of people with unsafe auto parts that we knew about but calculated the lawsuits would cost less than a recall"""
"""Well to be fair they are incentivized to make money so that makes sense for them to do"""
"... ""regulations"" ... yeah, that's the government, and they do regulate - perhaps poorly, but that's a job they are tasked with."
Or just not have completely private corporations at all
What.
"""If a system is corrupt, then the people who adhere to the system and are incentivized by that system are not criminals. They are victims, and the system itself must be tried."""
-Dave Chapelle
"That's complete nonsense. It's not black and white, where you're either Hitler or a Saint. If people keep exploiting others because the system encourages -- even demands -- it, then who will fix the system? Who will ""put the system on trial""?"
""
"Put another way, you can say the politicians who work to make the system worse are also innocent because the system gives them incentive to rise to power. It is absolutely the responsibility of the individual to make ethical choices. It may not lead to much, but it's not magically okay now to exploit others for your own profit."
I don't give a mother fuck what he has to say about it. The fucking irony.
WHERE'S JA?
"No ethical consumption under capitalism doesn't mean we stop being appalled at companies like Nestle using slave labor. Its an easy way to shift responsibility to the abstract 'system', and refuse to hold companies accountable."
Why would we not also be mad at the corrupt scumbag real estate developers that keep NYC/NY in general and state wide politics a corrupt shithole for decades? Developers rape this city over and over for a few bucks & then fuck the people over for another few bucks. We have a top Republican and a top Democrat state reps in prison over developer bribery. And those are the ones who were caught. Just because the politicians who approved this cash grab are scumbags  doesn‚Äôt magically make the developers not scumbags.
Those assholes are the same all over the world. I hope we could get rid of those.
"‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my fault I stole, it‚Äôs your fault for not catching me!‚Äù."
Huh....
It's not stealing if the government gives it to you. The government is the thief in this case.
Why should you be held responsible for a crime someone else noticed?
Edit- lmao guess y‚Äôall never heard of Bob Loblaw.
Coming off very libertarian...
"The government isn't the Futurama guy in the shut up and take my money gif. You don't think Related pressured the government into diverting this funding? It was clearly a stipulation in this project happening at all. We're not just talking about the Vessel here, it's just that this useless, now failing, structure is the embodiment of what's wrong with Hudson Yards in general"
You were so sure about yourself two comments ago
"Instead of just admitting you were wrong you instead shift to ""well can you blame them for trying to make money??"""
Yikes
"I think we can get mad at the developers AND the government. the state allowed Related to use money earmarked for low employment areas by linking together a convoluted string of census blocks to qualify, but Related actually took the money."
Way to walk it back.
"What a weird way to appreciate someone taking new, better information in and changing their mind. It‚Äôs almost as if you didn‚Äôt want them to learn and grow‚Ä¶"
"They don't, because that means they would have to grow up and act like an adult and realize people can change their views and opinions."
You are assuming sarcasm. What does that say about you?
"Who cares, 12 mil is relatively inexpensive and it‚Äôs a nice looking, arguably iconic piece of nyc now. Everyone benefits from a more attractive city"
"Seriously, millions of people (myself included) enjoy this every year. $13M is a small price to pay"
"13 million...for poor people, you mean?"
"But hey, as long as you enjoy it..."
""
as if i needed another reason to hate Hudson Yards
"A private company would never do that! Lie, cheat, steal and come out ahead?? Not in America at least!"
Yeah because New Yorkers love poor people lmfao.
New yorkers love?
As someone from Pennsylvania this is accurate
It doesn't help that the architects didn't fucking suicide proof this piece of shit. Just put glass instead of a shitty dingy fence ffs.
Nothing like baseless hearsay in a political discussion
I‚Äôve added plenty of articles to another comment somewhere below if you care to take a look.
I‚Äôll read it later today thank you
"Ask an stadium or arena builder, why spend their money when they can get the taxpayer to spend theirs,  just business as usual. I think people are of the misunderstanding that someone is actually responsible for taxpayer money to be equitably spent, it's comes in and then goes out to first at the trough. Poor, minorities, new citizens etc can't even get close enough to the trough to even see it."
Well no wonder they tossed themselves off the side.
this might be the most american thing i've read in a while.
If we had a society of window makers and window breakers it would very efficient at creating GDP. But nothing of real practical value would be created and people‚Äôs lives wouldn‚Äôt be improved. Just because people got paid doing something worthless doesn‚Äôt negate the good that could have been done with those man hours.
‚ÄúAt least the government isn‚Äôt literally lighting our tax money on fire‚Äù. Lol this is what a piece of your paycheck goes into
"People jump off it, but at least other people made money out of it first. Wut?"
"I mean the suicides are sad but they aren't really relevant to this particular argument. Someone called these stairs a waste of money, the person you're replying to is arguing the money was spent on business and individuals where it will be re-spent and contribute to the economy."
"Yeah i get it. All i can think about though, is red pavement below, and comments about the flow of economy above."
Imagine thinking architecture is not an art
when was the last time a painting cost $200 million tax payer dollars to produce
When was the last time a painting produced potentially hundreds of jobs?
you could produce hundreds of jobs doing road work and probably cost like 150k
"You asked when the last time a painting cost the taxpayers this much money, and I asked you when the last time a painting produced this many jobs. Are you now changing your argument from ""it's a waste because art shouldn't cost this much"" to ""its a waste because we could have put the money somewhere more useful""?"
"Not this time, because this was privately funded"
was shown elsewhere that the project was part of 1.5b in government funding
"Imagine thinking art can't be shit, and a waste of time and money."
Being art doesn't immediately make something good.
Imagine thinking the opinion of your own view is greater than the opinion of someone different
"Nope not a void, just a 25 billion dollar neighborhood, aka the most expensive neighborhood in nyc. So glad the rich get to have their fancy playthings while the rest of us suffer. But hey, at least the workers got paid!"
"Actually that money would go to construction workers, which are typically not millionaires and would circulate the money"
""
"All the money that went into that project could have been put to better use literally anywhere. Feed the homeless, affordable housing, etc."
"Edit: holy cow the amount of negativity in this comment section is absolutely crazy. I I don't care about the down votes, what I do care about is people attacking my character for a comment I made in passing. I saw the post, commented and left. Now I'm getting continuous comments about how shitty of a person I am. I wasn't saying that this project didnt help the people who built it. I was simply saying that money could (in my opinion) be used for something better. Hope you all have a blessed day."
"Well, the money that you spent on frivolous items could have been donated to a soup kitchen/homeless shelter/food bank too."
Did I miss the part where my money came from taxpayers?
Did I miss the part where majority of taxpayers want their tax money being used to feed the homeless/affordable housing instead of frivolous things in the city?
What? That has nothing to do with what you said. Nice pivot though
I could say the same thing about your original comment.
How
"You can say that about literally any spending, including your own."
I don‚Äôt have 200 million dollars.
"Well then it‚Äôs a good thing my comment mentioned literally any spending, and not only spending of amounts equal to or greater than $200 million!"
Ah yes my $200 spending a week is very comparable to $200 million for an art piece that was financed with stolen money.
"Can you demonstrate to me that it was financed with stolen money, or are you just making shit up?"
""
https://hyperallergic.com/494907/the-financing-of-hudson-yards-is-worse-than-its-architecture/
"I just skimmed through the first article and it never mentions stolen money. I‚Äôll have a deeper read once I‚Äôm home, but from my initial reading of your own sources, it seems that you‚Äôve conflated a controversial source of funds with stolen funds."
"Edit : appreciate you looking for sources and posting these though. That‚Äôs a way higher bar than most discussions on Reddit meet, and the first article you posted seems very interesting."
"Considering this project would only be a few dollars, if not a few cents of your personal taxes, it is pretty comparable. If you believe the government is misusing your taxes then you can vote for them to be decreased and reallocate the money in a way you find appropriate. Every time my taxes go down I find a way to put that money towards things like feeding homeless people, fighting capital punishment, or funding the volunteer fire department because these are things I care about."
Comparing your personal spending to the use of hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars is missing the point by the full length of Manhattan
"With all due respect, only mentioning the last part of my statement when the first part of it encapsulated public spending is willfully missing the point."
"Well it certainly helps keep the people involved in the project and their families in homes and with food, and it helps people who are working across buildings with their jobs so that they can stay off the streets and donate to homeless charity themselves. But then this is subjective. If you think simply giving the homeless food and shelter without a well-defined return value is a better use of money, this could work too."
"I wasn't actually suggesting anything. I was just making a statement, an opinion if you will. You can find a positive and negative with my comment and all the other comments about this project feeding families, etc."
"you say using your fancy phone or computer, that you dont need, and could have used said money helping the needy. Get over your virtue signaling foolishness"
"Um... I work helping recovering addicts who are homeless get clean, find jobs and a place to stay. Just because I have a phone ( I've had the same one for several years now) doesn't mean I don't do my part to help people out. I hope you find freedom from your anger and resentment. Peace."
It technically did.  The construction workers fed their families and kept a roof over their head for the construction of it.   And still does with maintenance.
"Look I'm not saying ""Fuck the people who built this thing, they don't deserve a salary"" I'm saying that this amount of money could help a lot more people out than what it was spent on. I mean for gods sake its closed a majority of the time because people are using it to kill themselves. Thats great it helped people with jobs out, I'm not bashing that."
"The Eiffel Tower, the Space Needle, the Statue of Liberty, and other monuments around the world are basically also wastes of money in this sense. I think it's a fallacy to say that if a better choice of spending exists, that means any alternative is bad."
Okay
""
Wow thats pretty messed up!
Funny how the dude below you said the exact same thing yet you got downvoted. People on Reddit aren‚Äôt too smart.
"I don't really care lol. I get art and stuff but a $200 million dollar stair case is a bit much. $200 million dollars could really make a difference if it was used towards helping the homeless population eat, bathe, and have safe housing."
hypocrite
Ok
"If you feed the homeless, they are just going to be hungry tomorrow, at least paying engineers allows them to practice their talent."
Oh you mean engineers who make decent salaries?
What I mean to say is that it is ok to feed parts of our culture that are good to have.
This is a subtler version of the broken window fallacy.
Isn't this just a takeoff of the broken window fallacy?
"What an absolutely awful justification for waste and abuse.  This website seems dumber and dumber every day, I swear.  People literally paid money to congratulate you on that turd of a comment."
"All that money was used by engineers, architects, contractors, installers buying made in china crap"
Could be made in Italy
"It was made in Italy and transported in six pieces by ship over 15 days, then reassembled in NYC."
"Awfully high and mighty there, casting the first stone.  Tell me, what profession is that not true of these days?"
"This is meaningless, since no money goes into the void, unless it's destroyed or hidden away, which would cause a proportional amount of deflation, making it a more positive contribution to society than this thing."
Good thing the planet has infinite resources for make-work projects.
"Those people could have works elsewhere, and they all could have made a hospital or something."
This is the worst possible defense for throwing away time and money.
that money is actually going to places that support people and are relevant today.
"Yes, I too wish it worked that way."
Thats patently false. Most buildings serve some function other than a tourist trap.
Apartment buildings are living spaces.
Office buildings are working spaces.
Retail are retail.
Art exhibits are basically something for tourists to gawk at.
There is no ‚Äòbroken window‚Äô. The money spent has to serve some function or it is a net waste of money.
This is what I tell people about the billionaires going to space. It's not like they launch that money into the ether
"That‚Äôs a fallacy, you don‚Äôt make money building dumb crap and fixing stuff that‚Äôs broken. Broken window fallacy."
Wasteful spending is still wasteful spending.
"The people at the top, the 1%, got most of the profit from that. The money was taken from funds meant to help low income areas."
"That's a nothing argument. The money obviously would have gone to contractors matter what was built, so it's completely disingenuous to use that as a justification. That money was specifically intended to be used for projects to help poor neighborhoods, not to build shit-heap tourist traps that benefit no one but the builders."
My hometown recently spent something like 18 million in taxpayers money on an avant-garde Piglet statue where the colors only line up if the sun hits it just right. Barely looks like Piglet.
"Its terrible and got tons of push back, but gentrification stops for no man, woman, or child. It's not like our homelessness is spiralling out of control or anything"
It‚Äôs $8 million and 18 feet tall!
"That's the one. I always loved all the Winnie the Pooh characters, but from the bottom of my heart, fuck you Piglet"
"There was an article about this recently saying how there are other buildings, like the Guggenheim, that have open staircases and no suicides because it is actually an attractive building. This thing is just a vanity project. Also when this was either first proposed or first opened it was mentioned that people would jump and the architects were idiots for not taking that into account. The person who wrote that review recently said they were never so sad to be right."
Why are these stairs inherently more dangerous in people wanting to commit suicide compared to regular bridges?
Jumping onto concrete is a much better way to ensure death than jumping into water
"you cant casually stroll down a lot of bridges, its awkward getting to the edge, cant take a cab right up to it. stuff like that. just a guess. Like harder to get to, people are too lazy to actually do it."
Yeah unless they have a pedestrian path and a low railing it‚Äôs not exactly easy to access to actually jump. And a lot of bridges aren‚Äôt high enough to actually kill at consistency a jumper would want. They want to escape life not be crippled. So to them it needs to guarantee the kill.
I'm not sure that this creates more suicides than there would be if it never existed. It's just a place to do it but it doesn't actively cause anyone to off themselves.
That's interesting. My first thought was how many people will commit suicide here as I entered the newly opened Groningen Forum in the Netherlands. Look it up.
"I'm fine with rich people spending their money on stupid shit, as long as it's not harmful to the planet, the problem we're having now is that they've hoarded too much of it."
Agreed. Many times I need a staircase and can't find one because the rich people are hoarding all the staircases.
Yeah! What the not_lemming said
"We all down here trying to climb the career ladder, when rich people have staircases!"
2 more replies
"It‚Äôd be less frustrating if the same companies spending all this money on stairs weren‚Äôt also underpaying their employees. If you pay your employees well, give them good benefits, vacation etc. then yeah, go ahead and drop on some dumb shit, but if you‚Äôre pinching pennies on your workers, fuck you for spending $200,000,000 on stairs."
"Yeah, I have to laugh at the comments here like ""durrr the money is going to the workers!!"" Like...do you know how a business works? It's going towards a wealthy contractor's profits, a bunch of construction workers aren't getting $200m"
It‚Äôs time like this that I remember that Reddit is run by 16 year olds
Rich people shouldn't have the government subsidizing their stupid shit.
Oh no definitely not.
"Unfortunately, concrete, steel, glass, and plastic making are all pretty bad for the environment."
"Good job, you've pointed out something bad. How do you suggest we fix it? Do you have an effective and efficient replacement for the world's most durable building materials?"
"I'm fine with rich people spending their money on stupid shit, as long as it's not harmful to the planet..."
"Unfortunately, concrete, steel, glass, and plastic making are all pretty bad for the environment."
Then you who couldn't remember two comments in one go replied with this drivel
"Good job, you've pointed out something bad. How do you suggest we fix it? Do you have an effective and efficient replacement for the world's most durable building materials?"
"The complaint isn't that the material were used fullstop nor especially was it about their use when building important and necessary things, it's that this was some rich person's ""stupid shit"" that was ""harmful to the planet""."
Maybe read a few books so two comments isn't too big of a challenge for your memory making you forget simple context leading to an irrelevant and wrong gotcha moment.
yea lol your reply was perfectly in line with the discussion.
Sarcasm?
I'm a different person so I was not being sarcastic.
"I saw you were a different person, I'm just obviously not used to even slight encouragement online."
"I was thinking more along the lines of don‚Äôt build what you don‚Äôt need, like a giant suicide staircase.  Other than that you can draw up plans that minimize use of those materials.  All but plastic can be recycled for use in similar types of materials.  Plastic recycling usually ends up in a downgraded product."
That‚Äôs not how the money system works. You literally can‚Äôt ‚Äòhoard‚Äô it. Money is always in circulation.
Lololol
Let me know an example of how wealth can be ‚Äòhoarded‚Äô
"I have $2,000 in a bank account that hasn‚Äôt moved in over 20 years. I don‚Äôt use it when I consider purchases. I don‚Äôt consider it when I need cash. I just keep it there, not even in a high-interest account, so it isn‚Äôt being invested in any substantial way. That money does absolutely nothing for anybody except for maybe my bank, but even that‚Äôs negligible. I don‚Äôt help the economy. I don‚Äôt help businesses. I don‚Äôt help myself. I just store that money. I have taken that money out of circulation. It is hoarded in my bank account."
Now imagine I have tens of billions of dollars. How much might I hoard then? What might that amount of money do if it‚Äôs injected into the economy?
Not to mention the lack of taxes paid by such individuals
2 problems.
Banks only reserve a small percentage of funds and loan out the rest. So most of your $2k is circulating through the economy as we speak.
"Billionaires don‚Äôt keep billions in the bank. They own stock, which most of time started out worth $0 and grew in value (created out of thin air btw) into the number (which is literally just a calculation based on two other numbers) that you now perceive them to be ‚Äòhoarding‚Äô."
""
"Let‚Äôs ignore you being an incorrect ass, and I will apologize for daring to criticize people with unlimited lines of credit based off of stock value created through labor they actively fuck over and is used for things like yachts and spaceships that have negligible impact on the general population while also spending millions in dollars to avoid paying taxes, which actually would have a direct benefit to the populace, an effect which, time and time again, has actually been proven to stimulate the economy and promote general growth."
What specifically did I say that was untrue?
""
The stock market by-and-large doesn't create jobs.
You‚Äôre right but reddit won‚Äôt like it.
Bezos doesn‚Äôt have 200B dollar bills under a mattress that nobody else can have. He owns 51.7 million little pieces of Amazon that a hell of a lot of people want to buy from him.
"And that‚Äôs not even getting into the fact that wealth is no static, and is not zero sum. Total wealth goes up constantly."
"For a real mind bender, every single person on the planet can become wealthier even while the wealth gap rises."
It‚Äôs a New York City landmark. In 100 years it could easily be as popular as the Statue of Liberty or the Empire State Building. Do you think they were wastes of money?
WHO WOULD WIN?
"A beautifully crafted bronze statue gifted by an ally, symbolising liberty, democracy, and hope"
Suicide stairs
"Well, the Statue of Liberty was a gift from France and the Empire State building has housed countless businesses and workers over the 90 years since it opened. So, no neither of them were wastes of money."
But the Vessel?
"Yeah,  huge waste of money. No offices, no workers, keeps getting shut down because the only use for the thing is to provide a convenient place to off one's self. I don't really see a big return on the investment coming from that."
"Statue of Liberty from France, The Vessel from Italy."
No workers? It didn't autonomously self-assemble.
""
"EDIT: No idea how many visitors, but <50-75k"
The Vessel was not a gift from Italy. The pieces were manufactured there and shipped to the US.
"How many offices does the Vessel house? The Empire State Building has roughly 20,000 tenants."
"And the Vessel keeps getting closed because of the suicides, 5 months in early '21 and counting. The risk of suicide is so high they won't even allow people to visit it alone, you have to be in a group.... or rather you would have to be  in a group, if you could visit it, because it's closed."
">75,000+ visitors per day,"
"I don't know where you go that figure, but from what I could find...  ""While its"" [The Vessel] ""visitor traffic on its opening weekend rivaled that of Rockefeller Center, the better-established Midtown attraction easily outdrew Hudson Yards on most weekends after that, typically attracting between 50,000 and 75,000 visits each day."""
"That's Rockefeller Center drawing 50-75k per day, not the Vessel."
ALL ART SHOULD BE BRUTALIST 1960s CEMENT OFFICE BUILDINGS.  IT IS SO DECREED
"The Empire State Building and Rockefeller Center are Art Deco buildings built in 1930's, not brutalist 60's office buildings, but I get your joke."
If your in New York to visit a building go to freedom tower. Specifically the museum in the basement
But imagine if they WERE brutalist! Think of how many more OFFICES they could fit! :P
""
"It's been closed twice, due to suicides, and that sort of establishes a pattern. So, yeah, it keeps getting closed."
"Yep, I misread. I have no idea how many people visit, but it's been packed every time I've been in the area."
"It's an attraction, not an office building. So? You're talking ROI, which likely is favorable. That also makes the distinction of whether it was a paid, commissioned work or a gift less important."
"On suicides, ESB is certainly not immune with what, 30?  Steps should be taken to mitigate them at The Vessel. You don't destroy a public art display, a building, a bridge, etc because of it."
These dudes would never have let the Eiffel Tower be built
if they wanted to make some money theyd put bars and restaurants and shit up and down it
"Um, no it won't."
I think that‚Äôs a piss poor analogy
Pretty things = waste of money
I mean I don‚Äôt really care I didn‚Äôt pay for it
Lol...so things that are wrong are fine as long as they don't affect you personally?
"I mean this is money, I don‚Äôt care what people do with their money to build shit. You‚Äôre acting like the topic is rape and I‚Äôm ignoring it bc it doesn‚Äôt effect me."
Making the world a bit cooler and prettier isn't a waste of money
‚ÄúCooler and prettier‚Äù are completely subjective and interesting think this thing is neither.
"Hm yes, no fun allowed. Unpainted concrete rectangles only."
Every building is a waste of money. We should go back to Stone Age and spend our energy and time only on hunting
Every building is a waste of money
"Nobody said that, also this isn't a building"
"Good grief, my comment really attracted some idiotic replies."
Oh ofcourse lets just have pure brutalism architecture with no design or meaning other than saving money.
Lol since that‚Äôs the only alternative
Lol brutalism is super expensive. Concrete is not cheap. And it's super design/aesthetics focused. That was part of the problem. It was more concerned with making cool forms out of concrete than making high functioning spaces that are a pleasure to occupy.
"Sure. If we wanted to waste no money we could all live in gray boxes, drive the same car, and work in bigger gray boxes, but some people are willing to spend more for things that look nice."

"Who said taxpayers paid for this?  I know I didn‚Äôt say that, nor did I ever imply it."
Read better.
How does that cost anywhere near US$200Million?  Maybe the people jumping off the thing are the ones who had to pay for it.
"i'm confused, is just this staircase costing the 200 million? or is it attached to a building and the building costs 200 mil? sorry if it's a dumb question"
Imagine designing a specialized structure for assisting suicide and people in charge keep shutting it down.
‚ÄúAssisting suicide‚Äù? So you mean literally any built structure with high elevation?
"Suicide is usually an impulsive act, and jumpers tend to be drawn to landmark places where a quick death is virtually guaranteed.  Of course you could rent a room with a balcony in a very tall hotel building and jump off that, but that's less impulsive.  The public attention that's given to suicides that occur at landmarks can also attract other suicidal people. So famous bridges, observation towers, etc. will often have some kind of suicide prevention measures like enclosures or nets."
"Honestly, I do think the designers should have anticipated that something like this would become a suicide hotspot, and that it would be virtually impossible to secure the structure without compromising its aesthetics."
Damn I guess we shouldn't have built the golden gate bridge then
..or perhaps that's why we installed suicide prevention nets on it like many suggest here..
"Sure, take precautions. But there are people here that want the vessel demolished because of suicides which is insane"
angry cavemen noises
The last one I heard of was a 14 yo boy there with his family.  They had stopped allowing people going up alone
""
The jumpers kinda selfish ngl. Man just wanna see cool lookin stairs.
The most recent one was a 14 year old boy there with his family if I remember correctly
"I'm all for mental health, but the random tourists at the attraction in the middle of the day did nothing to deserve you throwing your suicide on them."
"Because when life has driven you to that point, clearly the only thing you think about is others."
This is the same shit as telling the people with suicidal thoughts to think about their family. It doesn‚Äôt help them at all and you‚Äôre basically telling them their only reason to live is for others pleasure.
You killing yourself doesn‚Äôt give you free pass to fuck up other people. I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not going to cut you this slack because you want to die that you get a free pass to do whatever you want on the way out.
"Of all the reasons on why you should stop a person from killing themselves, this is your main one?"
"Like, what are you going to do? Put them in prison."
"I wasn‚Äôt even saying it‚Äôs okay, I just wanted to explain why people do it."
imagine making a super tall dangerous structure and not providing any safety measures to stop people from jumping when its common knowledge that people like to jump off stuff when they want to commit suicide
""
If we can help them thrive that should be a priority.
"Otherwise people who don‚Äôt need to or even want to die will kill themselves over a temporary episode. When I get overwhelmed by sensory issues I sometimes hurt myself, it would be dangerous for me to have easy access to that for everyone with no barriers and no actual help."
If you disagree that only tells me you‚Äôre just pretending to care.
"I mean, they had to have known though, right?"
The guy who built/paid for it is who wants to shut it down after a 14 year old jumped from the top level a few weeks back.
"They tried raising the railings, tripled security, trained security/staff in warning signs of suicide and how to speak to someone considering it, put signs up everywhere offering free help if suicidal, changed the admission to at least 2 people per group because jumpers came alone."
"But then this 14 year old with a history of suicide attempts came in from NJ with his mom, dad and little sister. They went to the top. He was playing with his little sister (iirc, she‚Äôs 10) then he launched himself off right in front of his family."
"Really sad shit. Obviously, people might just commit suicide elsewhere but the public being subjected to seeing someone jump/die on the structure and on the ground is a horrific trauma, but there‚Äôs also the danger a falling person poses to bystanders."
"So between all that and the fact that most of us locals hated it and the suicides made it more hateable, the guy shutting it down for everyone‚Äôs safety is a big ass relief."
"And rip the people below that may get hit, and peace to those living with PTSD after witnessing a suicide"
"Why did they build this though? I love NYC, but this was a colossal waste of good money. The stairs don't even take you anywhere."
"As morbid as it sounds, in a way, that's kind of a compliment. People that want to end their lives seeking out the structure you created to give their final act whatever meaning they are imagining at the time."
Maybe they could put some images or words somewhere that might help people reconsider their decision or reevaluate what lead them to that point. Maybe a phone that when you pick it up there's someone on the other end to help them.
"Ya for reals. If I was gonna kill myself I'd splatter my brains on the mayor's house instead. I'd hate to traumatize innocent people, or even worse, land on one."
"I‚Äôll probably get downvoted to hell for this, but committing suicide in public areas has always seemed like wanting attention to me. Like I realize they just don‚Äôt care anymore and want to get it over with, but it‚Äôs traumatizing as hell for people who see it. While I‚Äôd rather people not commit suicide at all, there‚Äôs definitely ways to do it without traumatizing other people. I can only imagine what the 10 year old girl felt when her brother who was just playing with her felt when he threw himself off the top of stairs."
committing suicide in public areas has always seemed like wanting attention to me
"I think that's a fair assessment. When a Buddhist monk sets themself on fire they are certainly doing it for the attention. I don't necessarily consider the attention seeking part of it to be a bad thing, although in some cases it definitely is. I believe there are some cases where the benefits to shining a light on a situation outweigh the collateral damage. I'm not willing to try to generalize that assertion or try to romanticize suicide though. It's just that some people have their reasons."
Wow man that‚Äôs honestly such an insightful point. That poor architect :( you are a good human
Thanks man I try my best
How did they not consider this?
"Everyone knew this would happen the minute its design was revealed. Kind of incredible that they went ahead with it, without major revisions"
Did they have to paint a big red target at the bottom?
Makes cleanup easier
Wait until some genius puts one of those oil drum trash cans there. Saves about half the cleanup even if someone rims out
Why not a dumpster with the doors off? Less splatter outside the container.
You're still not thinking big enough. We need a wood chipper that empties into a conveniently placed dumpster with the doors off. Or a man-sized garbage disposal that drains directly into the sewer.
Just one of those giant skydiving fans to launch them into an impoverished neighborhood so we aren't bothered
"Oh damn. I think this idea is the winner. Like with everything else in life, let the poors figure it out."
Laser grid to funnel.
why not just make a quantum computer that uses every single person's mental health history to predict when they will commit suicide and where they will land if they jump off this staircase so they can make a manhole where people will land and move the manhole to the next predicted position.
"Oh, god."
Maybe Apple can pitch in some extra employee nets from China
r/cursedcomments
"It'd be interesting if they marked a target which secretly functioned as a net below the surface. Then they sign an NDA to get out.. and as we know, most jumpers are regretful of the whole thing."
"In any case, it's better here than in front of a subway train (i.e. the usual)."
I‚Äôve always assumed that any leapers have to change their minds on the way down. ‚ÄúIdon‚Äôtcarethatmywifecheatedonmeohshiiiiiit‚Ä¶‚Äù
That's pretty much what I recall as a synopsis of the study. The problems they had would pass (e.g. if they just left it all and started anew) and they feel new clarity on that.. but the problem of accelerating towards death will not.
"It takes money to start over, that's the problem."
Not everyone can afford a $1200 one bedroom apartment after a divorce or break-up.
"If they completed the jump, how would you know they regretted it?"
"There are a lot of jumpers, and hence occasional survivors. Of course there's likely some selection bias since the ones more serious about it would tend to jump from greater heights and land on harder surfaces.."
A lot of those come from the Golden Gate Bridge jump. Which is 99% fatal unless you hit the water just right like a professional high diver would.
And also a bit of reverse psychology as it could be the open manhole cover to hell
It‚Äôs kind of like the fly that they paint into the urinals to reduce splash-back
Then they should just lay down some plastic sheets

Would you make it that far center? I would jump on the outside overhang.

At only 150ft to the ground? You‚Äôre gonna need a BASE setup. Horrifying!
Seriously: if they built an amazing slide I bet the number of suicides would plumm-... massively decrease.
"""I could kill myself but... then I'd never get to experience that awesome looking slide."""
"You know. It's not a completely crazy idea. I mean, it is, but it could still work. When i was suicidal it was the little things that kept me alive. ""Will the world end 2012"", ""i have to see the next marvel movie"" etc. Although i guess it's important that the slide isn't disappointing because then they will just walk up there again."
"Never been suicidal, but I kinda get this because I have pretty significant bouts of depression, and it's honestly the little things that keep me going through the week."
"Get a hug from my daughter, play a game of Mage Knight, discover a really tasty craft beer, put my feet in my daughter's kiddie pool on a hot day and read a book while she splashes around, watch a funny movie with my wife, that perfectly brewed cup of coffee."
That's the stuff that makes life.

"Honestly I hate this thing. I love the design, but it was privately funded and the billionaire (Stephen Ross) who paid for it refuses to make the barriers higher because it'll make the view worse.

"LoL, no worries. I was just curious where this beautiful staircase is located. I don't know why people want to ruin it with suicides.What a pity."
Probably something to do with not giving a single fuck about what you think.

"A couple months ago I paid their entry fee to walk several flights of stairs. As a solo visitor you were not allowed to wander around by yourself because they were afraid of people jumping off. There were about 8 of us in my group with one guide. I'm curious how this most recent person timed it, but in reality even in a group it'd take about half a second to fling yourself over the side and there's nothing anyone could do about it."
"A different commenter mentioned the most recent death was a 14 y/o kid who was with his mother and younger sister. The two siblings were running around playing, and somehow he got to the 8th floor and jumped."
"i think being in a group with someone doesnt only mean that someone will try to stop you from committing suicide, but someone's presence will deter you from doing it in the first place. or, if anything, it will make you postpone it for some other time and place, at which point theyre satisfied and its not their problem anymore."
wait this structure is just stairs?!? I thought it housed retail or restaurants.. wow.
"There‚Äôs buildings around with stuff, but this structure is just the stairs"
"This specific structure is just stairs, yup. It‚Äôs apart of a massive complex thingy though that has tons of retail and restaurants, this was just meant to be the centerpiece of it (ex Cloud Gate/‚Äúthe Bean‚Äù in Chicago)."
"Tons is being a bit generous. The Neiman Marcus, which was supposed to be their flagship tenant, closed last summer. It‚Äôs doing about as well as any mall anywhere else in America these days"
"Well yea, ‚Äútons‚Äù in terms of any other mall or entertainment complex in America. Doing about as well as American Dream across the water, which is to say ‚Äúsurviving by modern standards‚Äù"
"I was there a few weeks ago. Tons seems about right to me. The mall was full of stores (extremely expensive ones so not much shopping going on) and absolutely packed, along with the whole area around the Vessel."
Is the Spanish food mart and restaurant still alive? That was nice.

"funds meant for ""rural"" or ""distressed urban"" areas suffering from high unemployment."
In the middle of fucking Manhattan.

"wtf are you talking about i go by there all the fucking time this shit was a waste of space and money, they shoulda build a fucking park"
There is a park there tho
"its an ugly plaza with some trees and an ugly death stairway, literally coulda done anything else and been useful to people. that place is windy af, at least fill the whole place up with big trees so its more barrable to sit there"
As someone who actually lives there that‚Äôs so blantantly false. NYC is still one of the safest major cities to visit in the world. Crime went up with the pandemic like it did literally everywhere.
"You have a greater chance of being a victim of crime in Springfield, MO than you do in the vast majority NYC."
Dude they are 100% wrong then.
Hell‚Äôs Kitchen is one of the safest neighborhoods. a lot of those apps are random people posting things they hear about. Citizen app is the worst offender of them all.
Your opinion aside it‚Äôs still one of the safest parts of the city.

Maybe money laundering too? What a waste of fucking 200 million.
Remember when that was a joke on the Simpsons? The escalator to nowhere? And remember when the mayor being a pervert was also a joke in Simpsons?
Before you shit on our city make sure you‚Äôre familiar with the fundamentals. This wasn‚Äôt built by us. This was built by a private property owner.

And you have to pay for it like an attraction. It‚Äôs in between shops and office.
"No you don't, just have to reserve a spot in advance. I went like a yr and a half ago"
They added an entrance fee to pay for security guards to try and prevent the suicides.
"I just looked it up, and its still free for the first hour and then its 10 bucks after that. Kinda weird system i guess? Doesn't even matter tho cos its closed now lol"
Seems like a recipe for accidents. Imagine people rushing down those stairs because they don't want to be charged $10 for staying for over an hour.
"I meant the first hour they're open, idt they'd kick you out lol."
What is it for?
"It was something to do for the day I guess, but its just a shit ton of stairs and an okay view at the top."
"It was built as a public art piece, an interactive sculpture."
"Get people to climb more stairs to be healthier. Nah, probably not that"
Reserve a spot....for this?
"Yeah thats how it was, now its free the first hour thwyre open and then its $10 for the rest of the hours. But its closed cos people keep killing themselves"
"Just to the right of this is a Mall/Food Hall type of place. It doesn't directly house retail or restaurants, but I'm sure it was meant as an attractor to add to the experience of visiting those retail/restaurants."
Those are next door in a fancy mall.
"That whole parcel of land is just one big spending flex. It‚Äôs built on top of an active rail yard (hence the name) and its hollow underneath, it‚Äôs basically a floating platform with massive buildings on top."
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong - is it an incredible engineering feat? Yes. Are the views dope? Yeah, my mom‚Äôs office has a complete 360 view of the city. Is a complete waste for a couple of fancy office buildings while there‚Äôs thousands of homeless people in NYC? Absolutely."

That's kinda sad..
Very. There are a lot of f'd up comments on this post.
I agree and I was myself making them the other day. It just so striking how jaded and cynical we all are. Probably why Ted Lasso is so beloved hah

I think a surprisingly large amount also don‚Äôt care if someone commits suicide or trying to prevent it. I know some people like that irl who aren‚Äôt even hiding behind a screen.

"I would probably die just from doing those stairs, no jumping required."
There‚Äôs an elevator
With that name and design I can't help but to feel all these suicides are sacrifices demanded by the machine god.

I really like how it looks tho
It doesn't look like this in real life. This picture is a fisheye or panorama or something. In real life it's stupid ugly.

"Not true. You reserve an entrance time, but it‚Äôs free."
It's symmetrical so two people can race to the bottom.

New Yorkers got scammed into paying $200m for a big chicken shawarma staircase.
The whole thing is surprisingly accessible actually. The inclined elevator system is really cool and frankly just as interesting as the rest of the structure even if you can't explore all the levels.

you can't explore all the levels.
I can‚Äôt believe how far I had to scroll to see somebody thinking the same thing.
"This isn‚Äôt made up of anything essential. It‚Äôs just a fucking staircase. They could‚Äôve put in a less fancy staircase, or just stuck with elevators. Even fancy hotels that seem unnecessarily luxurious can argue that they garner tourists to help boost the economy‚Ä¶ but a fucking staircase? What tourists are doing anything but snapping a photo and passing it?"
There‚Äôs literally no need for this. That money could‚Äôve saved lives. $200 million should never go to something that ‚Äúlooks cool‚Äù period.
"It‚Äôs for the wrong reasons, but I‚Äôm glad this seems to be in the process of never being used again (if the other comments aren‚Äôt lying)."
Shame on the architect. Shame on anybody who financed this. What a waste of money.
So don't spend your $200m on a staircase. Problem solved.
The architect is just the designer. They're an artist who needed to make a living and probably had little to do with everything else.
"You need to say ""shame on anyone who approved on the overall project"""
"How the heck was it 200M?  That‚Äôs the cost of a gigantic project, like building a factory or subdivision.  This looks like it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶. stairs."
"Original budget was ""just"" $75 million. So it only went 160% over budget. Apparently it's  due to all the complex steelwork and freight from Italy. It is 16 stories tall after all."
That's $12m per story.
The tallest building in the world was $1.5b in Dubai I think. So 7.5 of these could buy that (using your discount slave labour membership card).
It's also 154 stories. So about ¬£9.7m per story and it comes with stairs too.
Stinks of money laundering to me.
Or calculated tax evasion.

Surely they‚Äôre just jumping from somewhere else?
"Most people considering actually going through with suicide, like in the moment, are usually in a temporary crisis. Deterring them in that moment is usually enough to save their life so they can hopefully get help. I forgot what city it was, but they added barriers to the 2 most used bridges and suicides dropped overall by 30%."
"Wait that actually makes a lot of sense, I tried once but I caught myself because I felt like my brother was going to find me in the morning and I couldn‚Äôt let myself hurt him like that"
That sounds like the most bullshit statistic I've ever heard.
did you not read the article they literally cite it
damn so you're just dumb then
but they added barriers to the 2 most used bridges and suicides dropped overall by 30%.
""
Where else are you going to find a tall structure in NYC?
"IIRC the Brooklyn Bridge is a favourite spot for suicides. Also, people have used the Empire State Building before, that's why they have huge fencing on the observation deck now."
Huge fencing on the stairs. Problem solved.
There is actual science behind this. People will actually avoid suicide without certain triggers. It sounds messed up but it's been studied heavily..
Surely they‚Äôre just jumping from somewhere else?
"It's actually often the opposite. A lot of suicides are impulsive - the person may have had passive suicidal ideation for a while, but the actual decision to do it is often heat of the moment and triggered by some sort of temporary crisis. That's the whole idea behind nets/fencing at popular jumping spots, a lot of people turn back when they encounter a barrier at one spot and they don't have a plan B or don't attempt to go somewhere else."
In the article they interviewed a doctor that works with suicidal patients and he said that patients will find other ways to cope if a way to commit suicide isn't readily available.
If enough places add nets then overall suicide rates should go down.
"Oh 100%, but can‚Äôt go solving the root of the problem, just gotta make sure it won‚Äôt bother you and make it someone else‚Äôs"
"Im all for investing in mental health and community outreach programs. But this was. Privately funded project on commercial land. ""Not our problem"" is 100% a valid response. I dont expect my local Costco to invest their money in funding suicide hotlines instead of adding a flower bed out front."
"It sounds cold but lets rephrase things. ""A bunch of people keep killing themselves on the artwork in front of a business and now people want to hold the business responsible for their deaths"""

"when it's a ""tourist attraction"" and part of that is seeing humans flying in the air transforming themselves into spaghetti - it makes sense that they would shut it down. You'd think it would take more than 4 cases though."
Kinda sounds like New York needs Futurama-style suicide booths.
Can‚Äôt close Verrazano bridge.
"Is anyone else getting dr lanning I,robot vibes?"
"I'm just going to say it. I like the Vessel. It looks great and it provides utility by serving as 360¬∞ viewing platform for Manhattan, Hudson Yards, and the river. You may argue it's a waste of money but any urban development in Manhattan is crazy expensive and having a nice, public, walkable area and iconic structure instead of a place to store old railway cars is a net win in my books."
"Might be a ""waste"" of 200M but it was never my money to begin with."
"I like that it brings back the idea of spectacle in architecture. Not everything has to be a banal boring piece of shit. it was paid for privately, why not enjoy it for what it is."
"Call my crazy, but I like some functionality with my spectacle."
You can jump off it
Honestly it's a nice place to visit
Wouldn‚Äôt people from NY have to pay for this? I have no idea how else this would be funded.
"The private funders got public funding, so..."
For the whole project? Some. For the Vessel? No
"They got some, and guess what? The businesses that are now in that area are increasing tax revenue for the city that they wouldn‚Äôt have otherwise generated."
"Okay, cool.  I'm not against public funding, I'm saying it's misleading to say this was privately funded."
Yeah 10 years ago the area by Hudson Yards was literally a large empty train yard with nothing but the Javits Center there.
Now you have a ton of luxury retail/restaurants which brings in tourists and has revitalized the area and neighboring areas.
"Im from south america and went to NYC last year. Actually the vessel was on our itinerary (only took pictures from the outside, tickets were ‚Äúsold out‚Äù for that day) and we ate at the fancy mall and bought stuff there! It‚Äôs very interesting thinking what was on that place a few years ago"
Hope you come back soon!
"Its cool and sleek as fuck, but its grotesque that someone uses 200M on fucking stairs when theres so much suffering and poverty in the world."
"Ya would have been nice if he used it to buy some tractors for agricultural development in Africa,, but that's not going to make me hate it for what it is."
"Having climbed it, the concrete slabs that line the walkways were loose, and I couldn't believe how short the railings were. It's a beautiful structure, but also I was surprised they allowed people to walk it"
How short are the railings if you can give an example?
"Short enough to lean over, look at the person in the yellow in the lower left corner"
"I‚Äôm under 5‚Äô and I still felt uncomfortable being next to the railings for fear of falling over (granted, heights make me nervous).I think they were only about waist high ... which feels even shorter when you‚Äôre ascending or descending stairs right next to the barrier"
"Code is typically 1100mm, 43 inches. I believe they are around that height."
Every single high floor landmark in NYC has fences or very tall glass. When people saw the plans for the Vessel many were concerned about the railings not being high enough. But because this was a private project the developer didn't incorporate this feedback into the design.
"They should have made it more like a garden like the High Line, I really liked the Vessel when they were building it but they managed to turn the area gaudy and kitchy, with food tracks, trashy murals and ""upscale"" mall."
"I did the census in Hudson Yards, the penthouses are upward of $30 million and the handyman who accompanied me on my interviews told me the elevator buttons are self cleaning nano-technology.  It was a ghost town with very low occupancy. I once went to a building ( not Hudson yards but new construction in Chelsea ) and only three families from 800 units lived there, the rest foreign investors - second or maybe fiftieth property."
It frustrates me that there is a non-zero number of people who think building a staircase to nowhere is a good idea but things like a pedestrian bridge from New Jersey to Manhattan can't get traction.
https://www.libertybridge.org/
https://jerseydigs.com/the-highline-has-nothing-on-jersey-citys-new-pedestrian-bridge/
"They‚Äôll sell it to NY for 2B, it will cost 10B in reality, and no one will use it when the homeless people take over."
"I can see why Jersey City wants that, seems like there's not really anything to sell it to Manhattan though."
Americans will fund literally anything before improving non-car-traffic lol
"That argument makes no sense for the NY metro area, the one place in America with a shit ton of public transportation that‚Äôs always undergoing improvements."
"That‚Äôs an expensive ass bridge when the PATH or the ferry are options to get across without using a car. Am I totally against the bridge? No, but it‚Äôs quite an expensive investment for what would essentially be a third option (or fourth, I think you can bike through the tunnels)."
"EDIT: I misread the comment I'm replying to. Missed the ""non-"" which literally completely flips what I thought I was responding to. Original comment below."
""
Americans in cities want an alternative to spending hours stuck in traffic. Biking is faster than driving if there's a wide sidewalk or bike lane and in some cases like Manhattan even walking can be faster.
"Drivers should support these projects as well, as they reduce traffic by removing vehicles from the road more than any street widening could add capacity."
It‚Äôs privately funded art‚Ä¶not infrastructure.
"Yeah, this is the correct answer. It's not like the city built it and there would be a whole other mess of complications to get privately funded infrastructure built and maintained."
You know how god damn far away GW is from fucking Jersey City you pigeon?
That would be the best location for the bridge
The proposed Liberty Budge would connect Jersey City to Battery Park.
"It would be twice the distance of the other bridges (manhattan, brooklyn or williamsburg bridge) without the actual car traffic, and just for walking around for tourist. Negligible amount of people are going to use it to commute."
Negligible number of people are going to use it to commute
"Why? The Brooklyn bridge has 4,000 cyclists and 10,000 pedestrians per day. Is that negligible? Some people move to Brooklyn because they are able to travel to Manhattan but can't afford rent in the city. This would be longer, but it would make it possible to commute without rail bus or car. Right now that's an impediment to some who could otherwise choose to live on the jersey side."
"A Google search says 120,000 cars cross the Brooklyn bridge per day. That means pedestrians and bicyclists make up around 5% of bridge users."
So? You only want to build a bridge if it also accommodates car traffic? AFAIK it's not feasible to put a car path there. It greatly increases and complicates the footprint of the bridge.  The layout of the neighborhoods won't accommodate it.
This is like the Highline or Liberty State park along the waterfront. It exists for people to use and enjoy. Except this also facilitates new transport options.
I was arguing against the unsupported statement that no one  would use the bridge. Saying that the Brooklyn bridge facilitates more cars than people is besides the point.
I'm simply putting your numbers into context. I'm very pro-bicycle infrastructure but I'm just guessing 1-2 billion dollars in green/public infrastructure could be spent in much better ways. But I'm not from New York so they can do whatever they want.
I mean the bridge has six lanes for traffic and one 10ft ish span for pedestrians and bikes so it's not surprising that car traffic is like an order of magnitude greater. I'd guess that if the bridge has more space for pedestrians / bikes (and those spaces we're separated) use would increase. Particularly for bikes.
"The port authority just finished the new Goethals spans, which is famtastic, but that doesn't mean they couldn't do this as well."

Maybe that 200 million would have been better spent on mental health or just supporting people's basic needs
"Probably (I hate this travesty), but it was paid for a private real estate developer."
Is there any evidence the 4 people who jumped from the Vessel were not having their basic needs met?
"I can't find a lot about the jumpers, but one of them was a graduate with a perfect GPA from highly-selective Macauly Honors College at City University of New York."
Yes they jumped off these to end their life.
That is the evidence their needs were not being met
"Exactly. Just cuz someone seems successful to other people doesn't mean they're healthy/happy. Depression, anxiety, PTSD, BPD, they're all so hard to notice if you aren't dealing with them."
"(I would really recommend anyone who sees this to do research into the correlation between high grades and depression in students, or even suicide attempts. They're much more related than the average parent would think, and it's a good thing to keep an eye out for the people you know and try to make changes)"

If thats not anxiety inducing I dont know what is.
Shoulda spent it on mental health instead.
I know I made a joke about This being a Halo map further down but this is the real conversation we should all be having.

"""It'll be the staircase that reaches to the heavens."""
And then people used it to actually go to heaven.
They won't go to heaven though ;-)
Maybe try taking the little red bullseye off the floor...
I know at least the two most recent suicides did not jump into the middle. They jumped to the outside.
"Not to be too gruesome, but I was literally minutes from seeing the last one happen in real time. Came home from walking the dog and saw the ambulances and cop cars pulling up from my window. If we‚Äôd gotten home a couple minutes earlier it‚Äôs likely I would have seen the kid falling."
View from my window
"Yea, I was making light of a horrible situation, but that sucks.  Sorry that you're subjected to living so close to somewhere that happens so often."
"Its part of city living. I‚Äôd pay $12,000/year to rent a bedroom there."

"Not just any $200 million staircase, but a $200 million staircase that leads to nowhere."
If I like this post am I liking it because people are committing suicides or because it's a cool looking staircase or because the post is just interesting? I'm so confused right now.
"Suicides or not, that is one of the most impractical staircases I‚Äôve ever seen. Definitely put appearance over practicality."
"well yeah, it's more accessible than a bridge. It's also a beautiful art installation. I hope this doesn't cause it to get shut down permanently."

Damn you got there quick
Imagine spending $200 million on stairs that nobody can use and living in a city where majority of people can't afford rent or other basic necessities on minimum wage or even $15/hr
And this is why we can't have nice things
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline

"Or, we could create sites where suicidal people can get assistance in dying, so they get their relief without involving the general public."
They have at least one emergency call box on San Francisco's Golden Gate - mb install a few here?

"Yea I can imagjne that, after having walked all those stairs up and then coming to the realization you'll have to walk them all down again"

A big staircase to where?
Heaven.
Very dystopian looking. I dig it.
Solution; install giant trampoline at bottom.
But all those stairs... I guess Ill find another way to die. (fat guy here so stairs are a mortal enemy.)
"Fat girl here, all I see is a free gym where I'm sure everyone is puffing away so no one would have time to look at me  :D"
I'd probably kill myself too if I had to climb that many stairs.
They could try removing the damn bullseye they have at the bottom!
"Well, I am pretty sure people jump to the outside, where the stairs overhang the park. Inside, you wouldn't get far enough out, due to the angle. You would just land on a level below you."
Yea it‚Äôs nice and all but someone got ripped off for $200mms
I went there in december but it was closed bc somone had comited suicide just minutes before i arived
People on here making witty jokes about the suicides should be fucking ashamed of themselves! Those were someone‚Äôs family member and it‚Äôs no laughing matter. Show some decency
"As someone who has been there multiple times, it‚Äôs not as amazing as it looks. It‚Äôs just stairs"
I don't care if its privately funded. $200 million to fund a useless structure that could've gone to charity or alleviate the housing costs for the needy in NYC is sad.
A $200m staircase that goes fucking nowhere lmao
Am I the only one who doesn‚Äôt think the stair is the problem?
"I mean, yeah. My dumbass brain took one look at that thing and thought 'Jump' without even looking at the caption."
RIP to the people who fell.
Aside from the mentioned suicides I could see this as a goldmine for those fitness people who want to climb every step
Where is this?
NYC
Thank you
Are the stairs and the suicide really the problem here? Let's just ignore what's causing so many people to be compelled to want to jump off the top of those stairs.
Myself included.
"The NYU law library is like 15 minutes away. There are huge plexiglass barriers on all of the levels to prevent what used to be very regular suicides. I still can not believe they built this thing at all. Who wants a view of New Jersey? Also the Empire State Building is like six blocks east, and also has massive barriers to prevent anyone from going over. A lot of bridges have suicide barriers, and some of the larger and more famous bridges have had barriers added to them during the past four years. It sounded like a terrible idea before it was built, and it is. How this thing was given a green light is beyond me."
"Wow. Downvoted by a fucking idiot who has never set foot in the city, and probably can‚Äôt spell NYC"
what kind of a society are we that every place that's elevated has to be barricaded with plexiglass to stop us from flinging ourselves to our death? why are so many of us so desperate to kill themselves?
Must be those pesky iPhones
Pestilent Fruits of Slave Labour.
"Because the actual buckets of rat piss disguised in suits who are ‚Äúrunning the government‚Äù of every country need to be lit on fire and thrown off of a similar structure. Their narcissism, psychosis, and affinity for oppression are putting literal billions of people in despair and buying them yachts. Fuck a scumbag at a podium. Every single one of them should be in the dirt."
These words.  Exactly - they are literally wasting the potential of humanity so their great great great great great great great grandchild can have a golden plated yacht.
Fuck them with an unlubed cactus.
Humans are Slaves to Machines.
The rich are the Master Slaves.
What is a master slave?
"Master/slave is a model of asymmetric communication or control where one device or process controls one or more other devices or processes and serves as their communication hub. In some systems, a master is selected from a group of eligible devices, with the other devices acting in the role of slaves."
Here is a quick diagram explaining the function

"Yeah, that‚Äôs been workin out great for us. Smash the fuckin state. If you think the pyramid has two peaks, you are on  another planet"
"Words, meaning quarn phleb much, yes? Clueb such not ares less marbles for not. Yes, snacks when got bake Submunthing. Oh Z! Zee Best! Gosh, from mother lunch halved samwich. Sigh."
That was far more constructive than voting.
"Yeah, I‚Äôll never understand being so suicidal you feel the need to do it in a public place. I know some people that have attempted and none of them did it in public. One of them straight up said they didn‚Äôt wanna ruin someone else‚Äôs life by traumatizing them having to watch someone off themselves from a building. I deal with chronic depression so I understand how fuked the mind gets, but still I can‚Äôt wrap my head around jumping off a building onto a street where people are."
Suicidal depression can make a person irrational. It's hard to properly predict the effects that your actions will have on other people when your brain serotonin levels are way lower than you need them to be.
Reality Checks hit hard.
"Life is great when you are not constantly at war or being worked as a slave, because some people across the Atlantic and Pacific needed cheaper oil or a faster smart phone."
"It doesn‚Äôt mean you still can be happy, it‚Äôs just means that if you are totally unaffected by it you can make comments like:"
‚ÄòWhy would people want to kill themselves when billions of dollars are spent on killing the Earth and other people‚Äô
Paraphrasing a bit there.
"All the people that killed themselves were young. I could see being depressed if I were young, given the state of the world and our sick societies."
"It wasn‚Äôt the law library at NYU, but the regular library - Bobst. And it wasn‚Äôt very regular suicides, but a rash of suicides one year."
"There are reports people asked to put up suicide barriers at the Vessel several times, both before and after the suicides started, but the developers balked. They didn‚Äôt want to ruin the views, as though a dead teenager isn‚Äôt a little worse than a slightly obstructed view."
Because shooting ourselves is much more Civilized.
"It has a view of New Jersey? Jesus, no wonder so many people kill themselves there!"
Maybe just maybe these city designers should first address the problem as to why so many ppl want to kill themselves in this day and age. Perhaps we're living in a dystopian capitalist nightmare?
That‚Äôs not a city designer‚Äôs problem. That‚Äôs a government problem.
"This was a dogshit area of the city that nobody went to, a real estate development company made the area a lot nicer and put this ‚Äúartwork‚Äù in the middle of it as an attention-getter and crowd-gatherer to get people to come to that area of town."
"And it actually worked very well, but it is tragic that people have used it to take their lives. But, many more have used other structures in New York and they won‚Äôt be the last."
"Hey fuck you guy, New Jersey is dope"
It is a fine state and I‚Äôve had some incredible times there. The view is not worth having a $200 Million suicide platform.
Seems like that money could have been put to better use.
This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things.
Why‚Äôs that? Think about what you‚Äôre saying.
Sounds like they‚Äôre saying we can‚Äôt have nice things because people will find a way to kill themselves with said nice things.
Giant bees get confused
Why don‚Äôt they put netting up? That‚Äôs what they‚Äôve done with a lot of bridges.. side note: it looks diabolical
It worked at FoxConn factories.
"committing suicide seems to be about the only thing the vessel is good for. it's ugly, serves no purpose except to take pictures of. there are no benches, so you can't even stroll and sit down. you need to get a ticket to go on it (they're free, but who wants to plan to see a free park structure). and it's built on the most absurdly expensive gentrification project in manhattan, which is completely empty because nobody needs another shopping center filled with gucci and prada"
"Gentrification? Who got gentrified here, rotting railway cars?"
"they spent hundreds of millions to turn it into a rich people hang out that rich people don't hang out in, when they could have built affordable housing, or even just like, a medium nice neighborhood like nolita or west village"
They should add ramps to accommodate the suicidal paraplegics.

Crackdown?
"I mean, once they reach the top i guess some people   choose the fast way down rather than having to walk all the way back"
"Jokes aside, it must be a factor too. When it‚Äôs really easy to not commit suicide, you may just stop yourself and leave. Here they can‚Äôt even leave easily."
They have to go down the stairs for 5-10 mins if they decide to not do it
Probably couldn't find their way down
"As someone who lost a family member to suicide, the top comments are disgusting. Find another post to make a joke about."
"I hate to say it but if the deaths were the result of systemic problem there would be no jokes in the comments section allowed let alone the top ones. How is 50k ppl a year killing themselves not seen as a systemic problem? No one is born with suicidal tendencies, therefore, they must be a result of society. So have your laughs and keep being part of the problem."
Wishing everyone here is having a good mental health day
So glad I‚Äôm not the only one appalled by the comments. I wouldn‚Äôt wish the heartbreak of losing someone to suicide on anyone.
Do a flip
"The people probably aren‚Äôt even suicidal, they‚Äôre probably just so lost they give up"

"NYC residence were and still are pissed. It could've been affordable housing, regular housing, shops, businesses, it could've been so many things. But instead it's an expensive bullshit building that will probably needed to be torn down one day. Those who built it and approved it made off with the money."
"Made off with the money? It was privately funded by the largest landlord in NYC, if the contractors and builders made off with their money, then‚Ä¶ good? You could say the same thing about every nonessential privately funded thing. Your average blockbuster costs more than this and could have been affordable housing too."

There‚Äôs no way in hell this cost $200mil
"Edit: ok just looked it up, looks like it was originally supposed to cost $75 mil (still an idiotic amount) and it went over budget and is estimated to have cost between $150-200mm. What in the actual fuck."

I guess they shoulda spent that 200 mil. On mental health programs not a flippin staircase.
People have free will.  No one asked to be here.  If someone doesn't want to be here anymore they should be allowed to self exit.

Should've spent that $200 million on mental health help instead
Shoulda have spent that $200 million on mental health services and not that ugly ass 12 year olds Minecraft build.
"200 mill can get a drug developed for a rare disease, what a tremendous waste."
If the same amount of money that cost to make this uneccessary absurdity was spent on health care and financing the poor this could probably have been avoided
A lot of thoughts about removing the vessel to prevent suicides but no mention of why so many people want to kill themselves in the first place. It‚Äôs a public health issue not a architectural issue.

we should normalize suicide
we have billions of people to spare
"A set of aimless stairs, eternal ups and downs. The point of this sculpture is that everything is pointless. No wonder people keep killing themselves here."
Seeing such a pointless structure makes me want to die too.

If anyone wants to rage look into how at least some of it was financed. America is a Ponzi scheme
It should be taken down
I would suicide the shit outta that.

That red bullseye at the bottom isn‚Äôt helping.
Hell of a workout leading up to it though. I wonder if dopamine or serotonin boosts have led to people changing their minds at the top.
What if the real story is how many lives The Vessel has saved?
Suicide is badass
People are probably just too exhausted to walk all the way back down
The staircase to heaven
"Considering how unaffordable and broke NYC is, building a suicide staircase was not a smart move."
Spending $200 M on a fucking glorified staircase while mental health problems are on the rise.
Makes sense.
People are dying to see it again
Maybe... its a Vessel for souls...
What‚Äôs it a vessel for? Sore quads? ::nudges you:: AMIRIGHT??!!
"Everytime I cross a bridge over water, I wonder if I would survive a jump from the top.  But, that's just the way my mind works."
Where does this money come from to build a massive useless death machine?
why wont they just build a glass cover so they cant literally jump out?
Could have prevented some if not all of these suicides if they‚Äôd built higher railings and barriers on the upper levels instead of leaving them the same height as the lower levels for ‚Äúaesthetics‚Äù.
"They are repeating the mistakes of the Golden Gate Bridge directors, who for many years refused to construct a suicide barrier because it would ruin the appearance of the structure."
Imagine killing yourself and making it a problem for others like mate just fuck off in a river or something.
maybe don't make a stair leading to nowhere. how would you feel if you climbed 10 flights of stairs just to find that you have to climb back down with nothing to show for it. you know it is bleak at the top if you can't even find a starbucks up there
i wonder how many of NYC‚Äôs homeless youth they could‚Äôve fed and sheltered with the money they use to fund that vanity staircase to nowhere.
This is in NY?
unfortunately. it‚Äôs a centerpiece in a newly developed livery apartment and shopping center on the west side. literally no new yorker can afford to live there.
it‚Äôs designed for tourists and rich foreigners
Bruh they could stop a large amount of starvation but like the business people were like staircase yes
"Put a Futurama style suicide booth at the bottom, problem solved. Forcing those who don‚Äôt want to exist to exist is rude."
Hey quick question were is it
"the vessel is in manhattan, NY"
"Thank you needed it for ""research reasons"".....ye let's go with that"
Please don't
I love you stranger *hugs*
A waste of money that is now cursed.
I couldn‚Äôt imagine how the designers feel
"fr, i feel bad for them"
"This is so sad for everyone involved. The person dying by suicide, their family, the people who witness it, and the ones that investigate and clean it up. The mental anguish a person must be in. Truly heartbreaking."
This feels like the weirdest thing. If people want to kill themselves they will. Banning these stairs just to keep it out of sight will only serve to not bring awareness to a societal problem.
Just my 2 cents as a formally depressed and suicidal person. Getting rid of all bridges and high up jumping spots won‚Äôt stop suicide. But making it a little bit harder for someone to carry out their plan may be the extra time someone needs to get help or have some hope.
"Make the suicides a live attraction, easy fix."
Didn't they consider the ramifications before designing and building it?
This straight up some megastructure shit
How many homeless veterans could you house and help with 200 million dollars? Yay nonfunctional architectural art!
Free skydiving.
Not the fall and all that....
"Oh damn, i welded on pieces of that. Awesome to see but also sad"
What was the point of building this?
The mentally ill ruin everyone‚Äôs good time.
IKR. Those goddamn depressed people fuck it for everybody!!! they just kill themselves‚Ä¶..wait.
As a fat man this is a nightmare.  No wonder people are jumping off it.
Lol wtf why? Go somewhere that isn‚Äôt an attraction. Selfish.
Go fuck yourself.
Ps. Cunt
"...uh yeah, that‚Äôs how suicide works."
He saying if you are gonna off yourself don't fuck up everyone else's day with it
"I am well aware of what he is saying, and I am saying that absurdly tone deaf regarding mental health issues"
I mean it is a asshole move to off your self in public. Also there are plenty of videos of people getting clapped when dipshits throw themselves off building s
So that‚Äôs a ‚Äúno‚Äù on understanding mental illness...
Sorry but that‚Äôs a fucking bitch move. Jumping and dying in front of people who didn‚Äôt have to see that. Do it somewhere where nobody will see that bolognese
"Depression is one hell of a drug, I guess‚Ä¶I‚Äôll do some research and come back to you, but I‚Äôm pretty sure it messes with your brain enough that you‚Äôre unable to think about that stuff or something. Idk"
I would like to know more. My wife committed suicide in May.
The last person that jumped was a 14 year old kid who did it in front of his family. . .
You do realise people who are suicidal aren‚Äôt in a sound state of mind right?
No no I don‚Äôt
Well now you do. Always good to educate yourself and let others educate you on things you don‚Äôt understand.
Lmao
"What is the point of this, exactly? A bunch of stairs to climb for the hell of it, because everyone loves climbing stairs with no goal involved?"
An architectural wank fest.
Found the architect.
It‚Äôs for taking selfie on. That‚Äôs the purpose. In fact when you go there it‚Äôs loaded with signs saying any pictures taken there belong to Hudson yards.
Except they don‚Äôt.
It's art.
Of course it is
does everything need to have practical function?
What's the point of a mural?
What's the point of a painting?
What's the point of the statue of liberty?
It has neither practical function nor artistic function. And apparently is a public health hazard as well.
Maybe it‚Äôs exercise and sightseeing
I went up this when I visited NYC and enjoyed myself. It may shock you to learn that everyone enjoys different things and something that has no appeal to you may appeal to plenty of other people.
$200 million and four people‚Äôs lives seems an awfully high price to pay for something that ‚Äúsome people like.‚Äù
You might just be the most illogical person I‚Äôve ever spoken to.
Can‚Äôt have nice things
"Come on, have some compassion."
"People could be enjoying this outdoor structure, bringing a tiny amount of joy or tranquility to families and individuals during a very difficult time."
"Instead it‚Äôs inaccessible because someone made the decision to end their life in the most public way they could think of, almost certainly with the knowledge it will destroy this place for everyone around them."
"Selfish is the only word I can think of. It‚Äôs a bit harsh though, I‚Äôll admit."
"There's plenty of other high places to commit suicide, why do they have to be cunts and do it there?"
Terminal thirst?
Suicidal flexing?
Have you met America?
üòÜ
Build it and they will...go?
"I mean, there's 150 other taller buildings nearby if they fancy it, why close that one?"
Because this one is super easy to acces
Engineer: that‚Äôs not a bug that‚Äôs a feature!
Suicides you say? Where is it exactly? I‚Äôm that depressed i should avoid it
West side of Manhattan
"Damn... too far for me, oh i meant oh good too far for me"
Put a sign that says ‚Äúno suicides allowed‚Äù that may help.
"We can pay for 200 million for stairs leading to more stairs but we cannot pay our teachers properly, get universal healthcare/income..."
"It was privately funded by Related, the biggest landlord in NYC. It‚Äôs where your rent money goes, not your taxes."
Why can't we let these people kill themselves in a manner which they see fitting?
Proof yet again that so much of our built-up environment is anti-human.
"Maybe if whoever built this spent $200 million dollars to help people improve their mental health, living conditions, or any other societally induced causes of depression, they wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about people killing themselves on their ridiculous bridge."
Note to organizations or governments with an extra $200m to spend on stairs:
Spend that $200m addressing the mental health crisis in your community/society instead.
"It was paid for by the biggest real estate company and landlord in NYC, as a long term promotional project. Addressing the mental health crisis doesn‚Äôt promote your company unfortunately."
Neither does building something that turns into a grand suicide venue ...
"Maybe instead of buying fucking netting, governments invest into the people keeping them fucking floating? Im so sick of governments gouging and allowing people to die as if theres nothing to do about this shit. Fuck all governments."
Fucking waste of money for my city
Good thing it wasn't the cities money but a privately paid for art piece!
That's a great use of $200mil.
Pretty selfish IMO
"Let me guess,  this is in China."
Keep staircase open and block off a spot on the ground  to stay clear of. Some win. Some fly. Some die.
"This whole comment section really flew off the rails, kinda like all those people who flew off the staircase and oh my god I‚Äôm apart of it now"
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee SplatüíÄ
That view and thoughts are very eerie to say the least.. RIP for so many.
No benches?
"Idk If I wanted to kill my self I would cash out all my investments and credit cards because fuck banks, (amiright?) and have a really crazy vacation and then pay some village shaman in s.e asia to brew me the tea of long sleep or w.e and then die. Too bad real depression is a mental illness..."
"The last person to jump was a high schooler from my town, 2 weeks ago he jumped in front of his family:("
"It always reminded me of a wasp nest, hence I never liked it."
Not in NYC.
That‚Äôs a place I‚Äôd die for.
How do you like this $200mil staircas.. What are you doing? Step away from the edge... Sir? SIR?!
Please don't joke about suicide-
Why? It's part of human nature.
Do a flip!
"What an excellent use for $200,000,000 of tax payer money!"
/s
"200 million dollars for a pointless staircase, to look at concrete buildings form a higher view. Yet can't get affordable Healthcare. The American dream!"
Synchronized Suicide. Sounds like a sport and band I'd enjoy
Maybe they didn‚Äôt kill themselves. Just got dizzy n fell
"No offense, but I'd probably kill myself if I tried to walk up that many stairs too. üòÇ"
How do you close a stair?
Imagine spending 200 million on a glorified staircase - just think how much more could have been put to much better causes.
What assfucker designed and built this monstrosity?
Wonder what could happened if they invested $200 million in mental health instead.
"It is not Suicide, I am getting dizzy just looking at the Pic... The fell due to that optical illusion..."
Can people just go and die somewhere else? Bunch of selfish fucks.

People suck.
Selfish pricks closing it down with their acts.
Truly the most ugly thing on earth

Shitty troll account.
No actually it‚Äôs not.
"Damn suicidal people are so inconsiderate, why don‚Äôt they think about what and who their actions would effect?"
Edit: it was a joke
Because they‚Äôre unwell and aren‚Äôt in a sound state of mind. You might as well ask why people dying from cancer just choose not to have cancer anymore. No one chooses to be that mentally ill.
This is why I hate  suicidal idiots.
"Yikes, bro, have some compassion. You really hate people that are suffering because they ‚Äòruined a bridge‚Äô or whatever??"
If I was going to suicide I'd do it someplace like the ocean. I've thought about it. I wouldn't want to leave a mess.
I mean if you jump in a public place you‚Äôre a real asshole
""
"The awful suffering that leads people to suicide is a very different conversation, but don't think that suicide isn't an extremely selfish action. It absolutely is."
Bring a picture of your ex wife and her new lover. Stare at it on your way down. Boom. Problem solved.
please don't joke about stuff like that
"""Suicides""??"
May I ask what you‚Äôre confused about (not sarcasm).
"I‚Äôm not sure if your asking why plural or something else, but so far it has been the area for 4 suicides. 3 lone young adults. They then changed the place to you have to pay, added a mandatory buddy system, and more security. After that a 14 yo jumped in front of his family. And now its what you see."
The people who made it denied to raise the barriers or add netting. Because ascetics!
I was gonna go there but someone decided to not live there.
If you‚Äôre going to jump at least pick a place in which to enjoyed view on the way down.
r/evilbuildings
"Is there anything at the top, other than the view?"
Aw come on people deserve to die in style
The red dot at the bottom... It looks like a target.
It‚Äôs like playing plinko!
Now they have to put up nets.  Sad.
Who the fuck approves a $200m staircase‚Ä¶
In New York right?
just add a huge trampoline at the bottom of it?
"You have the height, you have a target üéØ right in the center. It's either a spitting contest or the final solution."
How on earth did this cost $200 million?!
And someone give this the go-ahead? What were they smoking?!
I‚Äôd spin and try to hit the bullseye like a real life version of Skate 3 Hall Of Meat
Is there more than one vessel? I could have sworn it was in Hoboken
Wholesome :)
Uh-
They probably end up committing suicide because they cant figure out any other way to get off that thing...
‚ÄòSuicides‚Äô
"Let me guess, China?"
The vessel FOR YOUR SOUL.
Whoever signed 200 million off on that needs a bullet.
It gets worse. They used money intended for low income families on this huge expansion to Hudson Yards. It‚Äôs absolutely atrocious
Humans are so weak they gotta close this beautiful feat of engineering. Like just do what you gotta do in the privacy of your home. Never got why people chose to go out in the public eye.
A monument to capitalism
The privilage of suicide when you can adjust your life before the eyes
"What a massive waste a money. A stairway to nowhere, a landmark? And now it's closed forever?"
"You think they could just put plexiglass walls or iron fences on the higher floors, or have a net around the base like Eiffel tower."
"Either way, solutions to jumpers should have been implemented long ago..."
"I was wondering why I didn't know about this.(it's in Nee York) It's because it's super new and is mostly closed. Also, the pandemic probably hasn't helped."
Where is it?
The schwarma
If I was going to kill myself wouldn‚Äôt be a bad place to go tbh
That‚Äôs a gnarly place to end it
Classic 'blame anything but the lame who made a poor decision' situation.
Where do we draw the line of closing things down and ruining them for everybody because a couple people killed themselves there?
Anybody else notice the homie on the second to the top floor sitting down on the ground? He okay? They about to catch one of these suicides live on camera!
How does that cost 200 million? It doesn't look that expensive.
What fucking idiot picks this as your suicide spot. Hit every staircase on the way down.
This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things
"Just make the railings higher, problem solved"
"101 how to be a deadweight for society, dead or alive"
Selfish fucks.
Alwayz have to ruin everyone else's lives. Selfish fucks.
And this is why we cant have nice things.
Yolo
Looks like gate keeping suicide from people in wheel chairs‚Ä¶with extra steps.
If you‚Äôre gonna off yourself just do it at home
"Aw, why can't they do it at home?... ("
"Very inconsiderate, someone has to clean up that mess"
Thanks fucktards it was nice while it lasted
There's always that one idiot who has to ruin it for everyone.
"It‚Äôs a suicide stairway and pretty much nothing more. I know people that work security there- they closed it recently due to another suicide, said they were going to ‚Äúreevaluate,‚Äù and returned with a plan to hire more security and CHARGE MONEY for admission now. So a few weeks back, someone paid their 10 or 20 bucks and jumped off the top... again... Disgusting."
"I'm probably gonna get flogged for this but i find it so horrible that people do it there.. not because i feel sorry for them.. but because i think it's so selfish and so inconsiderate of others... the death of these people meant nothing else than trauma for whoever went there that day, and absolute devastation of something meant to be intriguing and beautiful.."
"I feel sorry for people seeing no other way out but to take their own lives. But that can't be an excuse to ruin others.. imagine a child, or even anyone really, seeing a person explode on impact in front of them.."
"Even dying, some people insist on being a nuisance"
Cant' people suicide in other towers ?
Whata bunch of assholes‚Ä¶ go die somewhere else. Don‚Äôt ruin everyone else‚Äôs day.

Can someone please explain why you would chose this method of suicide over anything else such as drug over dose for example?
r/aboringdystopia
Seems like a big middle finger to people with physical disabilities
Youre really saying that about people that kill themselves?
Damn kinda strange I haven't seen any jumper videos from here on any of the gore sites I frequent.  People need to be quicker with the phones
Who would want to die that way. Just take some pills and go to sleep
With pills there is a chance that you survive and it will probably not be quick. Jumping of the staircase however is quick and there is no chance that you survive it.
Suicide is for weak minded people anyway. Good riddance
That is a very controversial opinion
Helium canister.
"Unfortunately, that is not true. There was a man that committed suicide nearby where I live. He jumped. He was alive for hours before he bled out."
"Yeah i know about those cases but i was talking about this specific spot, if you go to the top and jump you are going to die"
"Seems like a waste of money,resources and time."
"Art is great but its not great when your people don't have Healthcare....That are living pay check to pay check, kids that are going hungry and a population that's sick, depressed, hopped up on pills and booze going 150mph down the highway."
People wouldn't jump and your art would be respected/cherished by all if the world around it wasn't fucking burning to the ground....
This bitch beautiful‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ YEET
I- No...
One of my dads friends was the lead designer of that actually
Where's it at? For...scientific reasons
If people can keep it cool. Cage it up.
If you jump from the highest stairs you can collect the red orb below and complete the achievement.....THE FINAL WIN...
I'd kill myself there too
I wonder how the architect of this ugly abomination feels knowing that the sole purpose it has was triggering people with suicidal thoughts.
I mean they could‚Äôve just added elevators and aces a shit ton of money.
where are all the blood splatter stains from suicides? someone needs to run a black light on this
Have you ever felt like this? Everything hurts so much that you don't care about the aftermath...
Dude-
What a waste of money and land!
Imagine it gets shut down for good because of that. Fucking bitch move. Not once have I even considered jumping to my death. So many more less selfish ways to go out on your own will. At least try not to directly affect anyone like that if you do.
This is the ultimate stair for climate eco-warriors who want to sacrifice themselves at the mouth of the volcano and die to save the planet from their evil CO2 breath.
"If the only thing stopping you from jumping off a high place is a barrier, you don't deserve to be saved.  The hand wringing about whether this stupid stair thing encourages suicides is absurd."
For a fraction of the price you could install a fucking elevator
The nerve of some people.

Uh. I‚Äôll just say ‚Äúnot for me‚Äù.
"It gives you a 360 degree view of the whole area from one position, which could attract tourists. Tourists already go to the nearby Empire State Building to get a view that isn‚Äôt 360 degrees."

I mean when they made this no one in the planning room thought of people using it for suicides. It‚Äôs even the right height for death on impact.
Just cause they're first to the top doesn't mean they're the last ones to the bottom
Is that in Japan?
"No, New York"
You can see the person in the top left thinking about taking the plunge.
They built a staircase to nowhere. What did they think was gonna happen?
Well it‚Äôs high and pretty when the sunsets probably

There's literally a big circle on the ground in the middle
I gotta jump to ensure I dont fuck up my world tendency.
I do construction for VA buildings and it‚Äôs really disheartening the amount of effort that goes into building suicide proof facilities.
"There‚Äôs plenty of big ass cliffs in pretty much every state or some bridges that‚Äôll do the job. Stop being lazy and go for a drive somewhere where nobody is around. I‚Äôm not being heartless just realistic. A good friend who worked at the Grand Canyon said it is a WEEKLY occurrence, you can‚Äôt stop someone if that‚Äôs what they want to do. They would just go look in the parking lot for vehicles that haven‚Äôt moved or they find notes on them."
So true. We‚Äôll spend 6 figures making an interior stairwell suicide proof when there‚Äôs a 4 story parking garage outside. I guess the idea in this scenario is protecting other people from the trauma.
Waste of $
That looks like the type of architecture in my dreams when I'm in a hurry and keep getting lost.
It reminds me of the vents above the engine compartment on lambos

My question is why would they build a staircase for 200 million that leads nowhere?
I went up there. It was neat. Nice view. Good workout. Decided to take the long way down though.
I worked at a restaurant on the top floor of Hudson Yards and I can confirm this is totally true

Isn't $200000000 a bit too much for beautiful stairs?
Can they not put a net in to catch jumpers?
"This is cool and all, but there is no way it's even close to $200 Million cool. What a weird waste of money, there's no way the costs should be that high."
Well there's a fucking bullseye at the bottom dead centere where the fuck else they meant to jump?

"Thinning the herd, one jumper at a time."
They just need to designate a specific area for jumpers where they won't land on anyone or anything below.
Then assign two people there.

"Second, a big burly guy if you're serious about it to give you a shove if you lose your nerve."

I mean...there‚Äôs something about it that just says ‚Äújump‚Äù.
I mean. I would if I could. Something about it is really interesting
"I just watched a video of someone visiting that yesterday, random. Looked cool. I wouldn‚Äôt go if it cost money but it‚Äôs free so I‚Äôd probably go see it. Nice views."
Maybe they should've invested that ¬£200 million into the community instead of building some stupid fucking staircase where people who probably could've done with that money decide to kill themselves.
"Y‚Äôknow, some people install nets on these types of things. These guys seem to just say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just open ‚Äòer back up. Not like it‚Äôs going to happen again.‚Äù"
I kind of want to roll a yoga ball down it like a huge game of plinko
I want to power loop it.
"It‚Äôs truly sad, and I know Reddit needs to have fun with the jokes, but the last death was a 14yr old. Such a young age to go through whatever they were going through"
My favorite thing about it is the fact that it looks like a giant shawarma.

"Wow, what a lovely waste of resources."
"It's beautiful, but architects must understand humans are susceptible to bad ideas. So those ideas must be accounted for in the design. That would look terrible wrapped in glass. Maby a different color glass in each hexagon could be cool."
I wonder if it has some weird thing that causes people to act on the ‚Äúcall of the void‚Äù. Similar to how certain noises and color combinations can freak you out.
Have they considered taller handrails?
It leads right to where you jump
"It's TRUE. Everytime I wanna visit, it's closed. Sad for the ppl though. Depression sucks."
Am I the only one recognizing this from The Chainsmokers Takeaway music video
Remember Kids. There is always a couple of stairs available for a decent suicide
What an ugly piece of shit anyway. $200 million??? Anyone behind this project should be ashamed.

just put a couple trapeze nets across it every 3 floors. Put more motivational signs or whatever around it.

A lovely place to do it.
Stairways to heaven
"Just like Twitter and brining water on a plane, another thing is ruined by the crazies"
From the Hudson Yards website:
"The extraordinary centerpiece of Hudson Yards is its spiral staircase, a soaring new landmark. This interactive artwork was imagined by Thomas Heatherwick and Heatherwick Studio as a focal point where people can enjoy new perspectives of the city and one another from different heights, angles and vantage points."
"Comprised of 154 intricately interconnecting flights of stairs -- almost 2,500 individual steps and 80 landings -- the vertical climb offers remarkable views of the city, the river and beyond."
"Vessel is made extraordinary by the people who visit, and by experiencing it with others. Each of you matter to us, and to so many others."
if they didn't want people to jump they shouldn't have put a target in the middle
"Is the red center at the bottom, the target?"
"Suicide is badass, I say let them jump or put a net at the bottom, this is free world"
If you build it they will come
Parkour Heaven
Idk who thought this was a good idea
It actually looks pretty cool but usually the point of stairs is that there is something at the top?
"Well, I just spent 15 minutes down the Vassel rabbet hole, thanks!"
The Vessel of Souls
""
"Maybe they need to make the railings higher and unclimbable, as well as putting up phones that connect to suicide hotlines and perhaps have people stationed there who are trained to talk to people who are struggling. I believe we have to do whatever we can to stop people from taking their own lives. I lost my brother and it was absolutely devastating to my family. I really am hurt for every single victim and their families."
This is why I‚Äôm only 98% YIMBY‚Ä¶ some of this shit goes too far
Might as well charge tickets to pay this thing off
The call of the void.
Smh. Damn. I hate reading negative energy makes me sad.
Don‚Äôt close it just add an elevator maybe then they‚Äôll stop taking the quickest way down.
It's a shame we can't even enjoy stairs without something messed up happening?
Who tf proposes a $200 million staircase??
Make a net?
What a dumb way to spend money
A staircase to.... Where?
""
A boring dystopia
$200 million for a staircase to nowhere. What a colossal waste of money.
Build it higher then
Where is this? Asking for a friend
"Fuck I‚Äôm glad that isn‚Äôt anywhere near me, that little voice would be screaming"
"At this point, I want to watch someone hit 5 railings on the way down to the bottom."
If seen it in person but never went on it. It‚Äôs so pretty!
If I found myself trapped in this beautiful vertical labyrinth I might do it too.

I went on it and honestly it was underwhelming. Probably because sir was also extremely cold
"Anyone else see I,Robot?"
It is a convenience place to jump.
Where is this?
I would add Bouncy Pads to it!
Yeah I went bought a ticket. It was closed due to an accident as soon as I used my ticket. I had to send an email for a refund that I never got.
People just want to make their own Jackson Pollock.

Forgot the way down? Bathmophobic and sleep walked up there? Trippy stairs!
Did they aim for the bushes?
What‚Äôs the point of it anyway? Looks like good money flowed into the right hands to waste public money and build this giant useless contraption.
Doesn't look any more appealing to non-suicidal people either.
I guess design before safety will be next century's thing.
"Suicide prevention researcher, former crisis responder, mental clinician, person who struggles with suicidal thoughts, lost my father to suicide. So I know a bit about this subject."
"Responding to the folks who question the impact of a net, specifically suggesting that the person would just climb off the net or find some other way to do it."
"TL:DR Nope to both. Suicide is usually impulsive and in reaction to some life stressor. The crisis is time limited. Death is not the goal, it's just the option that is always there. Make it hard for someone to die, they figure out they don't want to and come up with another path forward."
"Most suicides are impulsive, quick decisions to make an attempt to die. The crisis is time-limited and most people with suicidal thoughts, or even who make attempts, don't die by suicide. If you stop someone once, they usually won't make another attempt. They don't usually switch to another means if their go-to method is taken away. People who want to shoot selves don't Open up their veins if they can't buy a gun. The woman who wants to jump off the bridge isn't going to step out into traffic if she sees the net."
"A fear of pain is a huge barrier to people trying to kill themselves. It's why there aren't a lot of completed suicides with knives or self-immolation. A metal net, like they are building under the golden gate bridge is supposed to hurt like hell to land on. And hard to climb out of. If people know they are going to get hurt AND aren't going to die, then they probably won't make an attempt. Landing in a net will also usually give the person a chance to rethink whether they actually want to die. Most attempters do not. There is some other goal."
"So that is the theory anyway with anacdotal support. It ""feels"" like the right answer. There is not a lot of good data to say whether they actually save lives or reduce suicide rates."
"That said, for an individual you are concerned about, help them come up with a plan to put time and space between very dangerous items they could use to attempt suicide (firearms, poisons). You can call the national crisis line and ask for advice. 800-273-8255"
""
"How expensive is it to just add a big net? Didn‚Äôt some factories do that shit in Asia? Very sad how something that looks so cool has this flip side, same with bridges."
"Let me guess its either in China, South Korea or Japan."
Rollerblading wet dream
Dirty Projectors
"makes sense, pretty epic spot to die lol"
"Fuck the appearance, I can‚Äôt believe they don‚Äôt put suicide cages or nets at this point.  It needs to be more common.  Even some dickhead traplords add suicide cages to balconies so people don‚Äôt fall off.  This kinda belongs in the assholedesign sub."
All I can say is it's beautiful architecture.
"I remember when the High Line was still just a rusted out, abandoned rail track. When it was first opened it was sort of a big deal but that was before the extensions were paired with ""revitalizing"" the real estate and closing all the gas stations and parking lots in the area. The last time I worked over there I walked the whole thing to find that they had terminated this architectural marvel with this ""experience"" here, a circular exercise route surrounded by high-end shops. I was sort of horrified by the thing, and I am not really surprised people are using it to end it all. Everything is condos and bare patches of greenery over there."
"Just add a circus net at the bottom, problem solved üëç"
What city is the in ?
"It's in Chelsea, Manhattan in NYC"
"To be fair, it looks most inviting"
City of New York took money from public housing improvement to give to developers to make a rich person playground and build this ugly honeycomb
Does it go anywhere or is it just stairs?
I‚Äôd wanna dye after climbing to the top of that too
You know what sucks..............suicide.
Was this in Dirk Gently?
So close to Star Wars
It does look like a good place to do it. Just saying. I‚Äôd prefer a natural beauty.
put a trampoline in the middle
"Let me guess, the stairs serve no actual function?"
They have to close it each time so The Vessel has time to extract the souls before the body rots. If too many pile up the bodies begin to go bad and make a stink.
They should have seen that comingüò¨

Imagine you think this would make a great date idea to take your girl and was your walking up to it some MF'er lands right next to you
I was just thinking today how beautiful it would look if it was covered in vegetation.
This looks like a bitch to navigate:
‚ÄúHey where are you?‚Äù
‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶. Up?‚Ä¶.‚Äù
"STAIRWAY TO HELL,, i guess"
Would be great for exercise.
It is a gorgeous structure tho
"Look at this enormous fucking waste of money why the fuck even build this thing, and now it's not even going to be used anymore. What the fuck is wrong with people spending money for this"
I think that‚Äôs where Clint Eastwood killed John Malkovich
This kinda reminds me of Moria.
"I mean, after walking up all those stairs‚Ä¶ the thought of walking down more stairs is just murder."
just put nets and trampolines and watch people bounce around
"This is super rad. Not gonna lie, I automatically assumed it was in China for some reason."
Great place to commit suicide to be honest would looking very cool falling through the middle
"If it wasn't outside, I bet Marvel would have used this somewhere in the Loki series for the TVA"
"I went there 2 weeks ago and there is a police man every step, you even have to book your free entrance"
Why‚Äôd you close a building because people commit suicide too much? They can just do it somewhere else! This grinds my gears
They're trying to make it into Central Dogma.
10 points - Outer Rim
20 points - Inner Rim
30 points - Middle
50 points - Bullseye
Is there any particular reason this place is used for suicide?
I mean..... That's a pretty cool sight to be your last ..
To be fair they made it pretty fuckin easy to do it here
"Damn I knew someone that worked for the company that made that, they were so ecstatic with their work‚Ä¶now I wonder how they feel"
Dude hell yes
They should build more!
They sure do keep the pavement clean though huh‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt see any red
this looks like shit
"It didn't even cross my mind that my question earlier could have caused any misunderstanding. Sorry if that scared anyone. (Wait, is that why that comment got over 100 up votes, 'cause people were concerned?)"
Nobody can kill themselves when it‚Äôs closed?   Just leave it open.
Couldnt they wrap the walkways in glass?
Looks like a nightmare. I hate stairs
Where is this?
Why close it? Do they close bridges and buildings when people jump from them?
Wank architect factor 11
I wonder how many are accidental or is on drugs
"i didn't even finish reading the title when i thought ""damn i could kill myself here"""
My office was almost outside of it.
What the fuck is accomplished by closing it?  If someone wants to commit suicide they can just go jump off another bridge/building.
A true monument to capitalism
"I mean, not a bad place to do it."
Stupid. Close every bridge then.
Acting like thousands are dying everyday when it‚Äôs a couple each year or so. Still sad but no need to waste all that money and infrastructure

How many suicides we talking here?
This is terrifying
"Interactive art installation called, ""Capitalism""."
They knew people in New York wanted to die so they made an attraction to help them out
Install a diving board.
Time to enclose it.
Just put a giant ass foam pit at the bottom
"Where is it and where does it takes you? Beautifull piece of art!! But no use i guess ,"
The key is to base jump off each level (from top to bottom) until the chute fails to deploy in time
Are there cameras everywhere of this staircase? Maybe some murderers on it and nobody knows they are behind the suicides...
"Understandable, have a nice day"
Safety nets would ruin the postcard pics anyway
"Ok, I can't be the only person who laughed after reading the title."
Am I the only person who laughed?
What a beautiful architectural design! So unique and interesting.

Lmao it‚Äôs almost a suicide diving board. Pick your height
"I can fuckig see why, jesus christ"
Anyone know where this is? Thanks
Downtown Manhattan
"Having been here, it‚Äôs actually a really pretty view when you get to the top. Strikes me as a thing they built that was originally meant to just be cool looking but then they decided ‚Äúwhy not add stairs and make it an attraction?‚Äù When you get to the top the view is great and almost makes the stairs worthwhile (even for someone like me who was on the verge of panic attack the whole time because of the heights) it is sad people choose this place to end their life but I can say from my experience (mind you they were just about closed for the night when I went) there‚Äôs actually a security person every ‚Äúflight‚Äù"
Ugly af
"Did they film ""I, Robot"" there?"
Its not even an actual vessel as it is incapable of holding liquid so good riddance just kidding
Only 4 deaths in 2 years. I‚Äôm guessing the city fucked up letting this thing get built and want to make way for a more tax paying building to move in. A building of stairs pays much less than a building of apartments in taxes.
I wonder why hell I even wanna jump off it

How could this possibly cost 200 million? O_o
"It kind of looks like a suicide staircase. It‚Äôs really cool, but maybe should have put some tall glass sidewalls to it"

Where is this forbidden diving board?
Lol I read suicides as sacrifices and that shit killed me hahahah
"But yeah no, the suicides were sad to hear."
Either life is important enough to close the vessel AND to force everyone to wear masks and get rid of guns outside of law enforcement and military.
OR
"We can skip the masks and vaccines altogether and let nature run its course and kill 2% of society and you can keep your fucking guns (but put a biometric trigger on them, and license them like you do a car, and you can lose the privilege if you screw up)."
Choose 1 of the above.

"Building signage: in case of emergency, please use elevators."
Yup. I worked on the skyscraper next to it and always heard bad news
Did they forget to construct the building? VE‚Äôd out all but the stairs?
Hoping to climb it next week. Always too busy. It‚Äôs so vast but would be nice if they could have some mental health counsellors stationed there.
The desire to jump from high places can sometimes be overwhelming ngl
Looks like a huge waste of money
This staircase looks amazing. Love the Gray and Copper colour combo. Sad to hear people are committing suicide there. Depression sucks.
source?? any legitimacy to this claim?
$200 MILLION for STAIRS?!?!?!?!?!?
No mind to think
I'm not suicidal by any means but if I ever was would be a dope place to off myself
But the bullseye is soooo tempting.
"""They were so busy wondering if they could and never stopped to think if they should"""

"its beautiful, but unsafe for a work environment. as someone who get unwanted thoughts, id stay far away, thats for sure"
Where is this place located ?
Hudson Yard - NYC
its because it's so open. many suiciders want their death to be seen by as many people as possible.
I think this was in a Connor O Malley video I can't find it now but it was one of his better ones.
L'appel du vide...
Put a pool at the bottom. Problem solved.
Maybe add a big Trapeze net at the bottom.
Thanks a lot! Now I have to feel bad for laughing at this post.
I fail to see how this is the staircase‚Äòs fault & why it needs to be punished.
I would totally commit suicide on this staircase.
"Seems like the suicide problem could have easily been predicted. But damn, I hate that we can't have nice things."

I went there with my dad but it was closed. They said they were working on repairs. Now I‚Äôm not so sure
Just put nets every few levels.
People are probably giving up trying to go up it and then they can't get down so they just take the quick way

The owner will charge you royalty fees if you film your own demise there.
Would a suicide theme park be legal? They should charge for this.
Nice. I wonder if you can jog on that thing. Tons of people do stairs at football stadiums. Be a nicer view and plenty of resting points.

That's giving me some strong Crysis vibes.
why not make the bottom level a big trampoline?

"I went there in 2019, around when Endgame came out. It's very cool, but I could definitely see it being easy for someone to want to jump."
"This is stupid, closing it only makes it so that someone offs themselves elsewhere, instead of resources put into security, put resources into mental healthcare, get people the help they need instead of delaying their suicide by a couple of minutes."
That‚Äôs actually not true. Many if not most suicides are spur of the moment decisions and it‚Äôs been shown that closing off easy access in other locales leads to a dramatic reduction in the local suicide rate.
A funeral service company would be a great business next to the building.
I wonder why my wife keeps asking me to take her‚Ä¶

"I've never seen a suicide leap that required a test of skill before.  If you think you're a loser who does nothing right, you'd want to avoid this place."

I wonder what draws people to commit suicide here..
Hell of a workout leading up to it though. I wonder if dopamine or serotonin boosts have led to people changing their minds at the top.
What if the real story is how many lives The Vessel has saved?
I dont get why they close it. Just clean up the body and move along.

Knowing that and being mentally prepared is key to get through the hard times! I also strongly recommend a personal relationship with GOD"
"Hey, I jumped there, sadly it was to short I only end up having my joints broke"

Isn't this place where the song Takeaway by the chainsmokers was shot?
Why not put glass up?? Even plexi would maintain the aesthetic and probably not be too heavy‚Ä¶better than tearing it down.
Because of navigation difficulty?
Deaths aside that is an incredibly cool structure
Splat
Literal stairway to heaven
So it's... A stairway to Hell?
"Yep, I'll accept my cursed comment for what it is."
What a pretty waste of money
Let‚Äôs be honest. That‚Äôs not a bad place to dive for death. Yep
Now make it like a maze staircase.
Almost went on this once but it was kinda expensive and the line was too long (had to make a reservation 3 hours in advance). Seems like a lot of effort for a suicide considering how many huge buildings there are in the city.
Where is this located?
Why do people gotta ruin it
You don‚Äôt think people will jump for fun if there was a net though!
"I‚Äôm a bit surprised it didn‚Äôt occur to the designers that it would be a suicide magnet. Modern buildings and infrastructure are usually pretty carefully designed these days to deter suicides. People gravitate to the easiest place to go, whether it‚Äôs a bridge or a rooftop. And then once a location gets a reputation, and people know it‚Äôs a spot you could jump, it happens all the more."
Well this looks really nice.....aaaaaAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!
The should charge an entrance fee so at least no tax payer money is being used for the cleanup.
Where is this?
Why am I thinking about recreating this in Minecraft?
This reminds me of I robot
"Maybe spend a hundred grand on some netting, problem solved kinda?"
Maybe it resembles where we are all at when we entered the simulation
"Looks aight. Annoying as fuck to go anywhere, but it's aight."
I wish people would go mill themselves elsewhere. Ugh.
It‚Äôs ugly and useless
"That thing makes me dizzy just looking at it. If I had to go on it, I would be very careful on my hands and knees. Don't look down!"
Who the fart is just building staircases for nothing? Like there‚Äôs a demand for staircases.
Y‚Äôall just ruining it huh
Wow scary
You have to really want it to climb that many stairs.
"I actually applied to work there, even got the interview, I don‚Äôt know how I would‚Äôve reacted if it happen while working"
This is my fav place in NYC
Where is this actually Ôºü
""
That‚Äôs way too Harry Potter esc for my tastes
"I was there 3 weeks ago, my family went to the top while I was taking some pictures at the bottom, an employee asked me if I was with someone and them told me to get closer to my family, I didn't think much of it at the moment and assumed it was some covid rule. Now I see what it was about."
Hey wait I live near this one! Hehe nice
I‚Äôm so accident prone I‚Äôd accidentally fall
This is why we can‚Äôt have nice things.
"This was featured in that one Chainsmokers music video, right?"
"What if, and hear me out on this, but what if we made society less of an unbearable hell scape?"
Dang it looks really cool though
"I realized anyone could jump off quite a few staircases at the river walk during a recent trip to Chicago. It was unsettling and anxiety inducing. I wish the thought hadn‚Äôt crossed my mind, couldn‚Äôt really shake it the rest of the trip."
Sad. I like The Vessel :(
Shame since it's such a neat looking structure.
Wasnt there an project runway episode there?
My vertigo hates this
What about all the buildings with rooftop access?
Where is it?
always ruining the fun
"Or we could try and fix the fundamental issues in society that are causing these suicides, would be easier than any of the nets you guys are dreaming up"
My BF was there when someone jumped. Had to shut the whole thing down. It was pretty sad. (Not that it was closed but for the kid)
I heard a story about a guy who killed himself jumping out of the IDS tower in Minneapolis. My company had regular deliveries to the building and one of our delivery guys heard the story from a secretary who was there when it happened.
"The secretary said the guy came onto the floor and went straight for one of the windows. First thing he did was run straight at the window but bounced off. He tried again with the same result. Finally he picked up a desk chair and used that to break the window. He stood there for a moment, lit a cigarette, and looked down. After a couple puffs on the cig he jumped."
"The IDS building has an open, glass covered area at the bottom sort of like a concourse where people sometimes eat their lunch. The guy died on impact with the glass but since the glass wasn't made to hold up under that kind of stress it broke and ended up separating his torso from his head and limbs. Pretty gruesome for the people eating their lunch that day."
This happened after they closed the restaurant at the top of the tower because they were constantly having to deal with suicide attempts there. I suppose the lesson there is that if someone's determined enough then they will find a way
Looks like that place where Cap fought himself.
"I mean, maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm from the Bay Area so bridge suicides are a pretty well known phenomenon, but I can‚Äôt believe that nobody thought about that before they built it.  Any attraction with height is going to attract the suicidal."
Anyone ever tried to run up all of those steps?
It keeps getting closed due to suicides? Exactly how many architects worked on this?
‚ÄúSuicide is badass!‚Äù - Frank Reynolds
Is that an actual photo of a suicide?
I love it
The red pool at the bottom must be the target
Why dont they just put a meshcage on top so you can't jump without cutting the mesh beforehands?
Buy a shotgun! -Biden
200 mil for a staircase that goes nowhere no wonder this planets doomed
Corona is a helluvah drug
That's really tragic! I'd be lying if I said it doesn't look extremely cool though very cyberpunkesque
I love handrails!
Couldnt they just raise the walls with glass so People cant get over it to jump?
i mwan it is called the vessel
I mean it's a good place to jump off
Isn‚Äôt this the stairs that the Chainsmokers used for the Music video called ‚ÄúTakeaway‚Äù ???
Is it wheelchair accessible?
I seriously agree with the comments to leave the bodies there. Leave cameras incase of murders but it seems noble to leave the bodies for society to reflect on.
American culture treats death like an incest child left in a basement. People/society need to face it and reflect on it.
They should make the floor lava.
"I remember when Hudson Yards first opened up and they were unveiling all the attractions. When I saw this nonsense. I said I give it until hollooween someone's gonna jump, and I fucking swear like a few months later on my way home my citizen app went off saying someone got the record holder status."
lmao then stop jumping
Well....  It looks like a really nice place....
....... to end it all
Donate it to Crossfit.
Why can't they just enclose it?
Can you blame them? It has a target at the bottom.
"What a waste of 200 million dollars, just put in a giant slide"
"Isn't this the place where the chainsmokers and illenium filmed the mv for ""Takeaway"" ?"
Trying to climb that many steps I'd probably say F it and jump too!
I mean... if you're gonna jump... why not there??
Does anyone in America use stairs?  Between the obesity epidemic and people not being able to spare an extra couple of minutes due to strict work schedules?
Replace red light landing zone with funnel to a crematorium.
Why the fuck are Irish idiots spending 200 million on a fucking staircase instead of I dunno. Helping people. Now all they've done is make a suicide machine.
I was there about a month ago to go to the edge and was pretty let down this was closed.
Is this where The Chainsmokers' Takeaway was shot?
This looks like something in Dubai
""
Just flood the base and the stairs become the worlds biggest diving platformp
Let them. Then somebody can get hired to clean up the mess. Thereby creating more jobs.
"This is gonna be fucked up, but what‚Äôs a more beautiful place to jump off of?"
This feels like the weirdest thing. If people want to kill themselves they will. Banning these stairs just to keep it out of sight will only serve to not bring awareness to a societal problem.
This is where i asked my now girlfriend to be my girlfriend. We went at night. It was closed because the week before someone jumped off. Very romantic.
Are we going backwards?
I know where I'm going then.....
great place for cardio
It's sad that such a wonder is getting closed due to some losers.
What a waste of money
Commonly referred to as ‚Äúthe wooden gyro‚Äù as I hear
Didn‚Äôt the Chainsmokers film a music video here?
