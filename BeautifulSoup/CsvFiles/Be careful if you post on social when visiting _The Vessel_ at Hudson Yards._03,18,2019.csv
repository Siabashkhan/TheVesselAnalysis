Clause 8 is even worse. They take the right to use your name and other info as well.
"The first clause is what scares me. Deliberately makes bldg not safe, prevents one from suing in event of injury or death. Are the T&Cs clearly posted in and around the vessel? (Tacking on 2nd as well)."
I saw nothing on the structure other then a scotch taped sign saying how many people were allowed to enter at one time.
"Just because they say you assume all risks doesn't actually mean you do.  If Hudson Yards can be shown to have negligently (or intentionally) created a hazardous situation, they can still get sued and lose."
Would it be considered an unconscionable clause?  I assume that some high dollar lawyers were involved in drafting the T&Cs so I can't help but think they would have thought their way through it.
"Just because you wrote it doen doesn't mean that it is agreed to.  Wouldn't take much of a plaintiff's lawyer to poke holes in this ""agreement.""  If Hudson Yards has notice of a dangerous condition and doesn't fix it, i don't think that the T's&C's are going to stop a lawsuit.  What they may be useful for is bullying a plaintiff into dropping the case or accepting a low-ball settlement however."
"Oh no. If they were put on notice that XYZ is broken and they dont fix it in a timely fashion or put up some caution tape, then their T&S doesnt mean poop. And thanks for clarifying the point about the negligently/intentionally creating a hazardous situation. I always understood assumption of the risk as the activity has an inherent risk (eg: rollercoasters) but plaintiff is not 100% liable if the structure is unsound or even if they did something to contribute to their own injury (eg: refusing to use the lap bar or sticking hands out the car). (Torts class was a while back for me, but I'm not an attorney)"
"Heck, if I’m reading that correctly if you walk by and some random stranger snaps a photo of you that gives the Company rights to use your likeness."
"On that thought, would that apply to their security cameras? Basically being in the vicinity of the Vessel is a liability to have your privacy plundered."
"Billions in tax breaks and gov't assistance...if they want someone's photo, they ought to pay for it.…"
This is the most critical point.
"If I appear in, create, upload, post, or send any photographs, audio recordings, or video footage depicting or relating to the Vessel, I grant to Company the unrestricted, worldwide, royalty-free, perpetual right and license (with the right to transfer or sublicense) to use my name, likeness, voice, and all other aspects of my persona for the purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, advertising, and improving the Vessel or any other products or services provided by Company or its sublicensees (in either case, now known or later developed). I understand I will not be entitled to any compensation from the Company, its affiliates, or its business partners if my name, likeness, or voice is used in the Vessel’s marketing and promotions, whether on Company’s website, social media channels, or otherwise.)"
"I'm not sure of the legality of what they're saying, but apparently if you post a photo you took of the Vessel... or including the vessel... you give what essentially is potentially every company ever the right to use your name / likeness / whatever for any purpose."
"“Company” is capitalized, which means it is a defined term and refers to a specific company (likely the operator of the Vessel)."
"Plus, the rights are transferable, so they can sell them to whoever they want."
Which is a lot more likely to bite you than anything else.
"You're a semi-public persona and some company doesn't like you? Well, you posted a photo of the Vessel, so they just buy your likeness  off Hudson Yards for a few grand and do whatever they want with it."
"Yes, that's what I meant. All sorts of companies buy all sorts of buildings all the time, and companies will work with all sorts of other companies."
"If this document has any standing, it means that if you take a photo of the vessel and put it on Instagram, and the 30 years from now you're a politician opposing the actions of a certain power company— the one that provides electricity to The Vessel's elevator— well, they can use your likeness however they like, make you say whatever using whatever DeepFake technologies exist in 30 years."
"And if I take a photo of the vessel from public property, I haven't agreed to any of that. Can I list my photos for sale on a website for five million each and then sue if they use itit? This whole thing is dumb"
Its the T&C when you reserve a ticket on their website only.
"I'm not worried about their attorneys coming after me, I'm worried about not being able to afford to attorney when they start using my likeness."
"it's not for any purpose. it's only for operating, developing, providing, promoting, advertising, and improving the vessel. so the cases i can think of this will be used is to use/take footage of the vessel to advertise, having security cameras, and fixing dangerous conditions if something bad happens. how is this different from other public spaces?"
"or any other products or services provided by Company or its sublicensees (in either case, now known or later developed)."
I liked the place better when it was just a train yard.
Said the EXACT same thing while on the property.
Wow.. this is crazy too.. can they even do this??:
"I will not exploit any photographs, audio recordings, or video footage of the Vessel for any commercial purpose without Company’s prior written consent."
"Two major differences: (1) Copyright law for buildings is different than copyright law for structures or sculptural work. The Copyright Act for buildings (a) does not apply to buildings created before 1990, and (b) for post 1990 buildings, does not prevent the reproduction of images of any building viewable from a public space. Both of these reasons are why you can go up to any building and take a picture of it and sell it."
"I would assume the vessel is copyrighted as a sculptural work, not a building. Although I admittedly am not certain how it was copyrighted. But if it is, like a presume, copyrighted as a sculpture, it's a completely different set of rules."
"The other big difference, and this seems to be what the controversy in the post is about, is that when you buy a ticket to The Vessel, you agree to its terms and services. You are now voluntarily entering private property. Similar to the above copyright rule on post 1990 buildings, you are now entering a private space, and you are taking pictures of parts of a sculpture or work that are not viewable by the public. By purchasing a ticket to see these private spaces, you waive your right to be able to take and own pictures of the inside. By entering a private space, you always need to play by the rules of the private space."

"if i'm reading it right, you could totally watermark the heck out of any pictures you take of it. that way if they want to use those pictures they take from you they can't help but spread your 'brand' in the process."
Free marketing. Some people will use it to advantage.
"From a copyright perspective, is it a building or a sculpture? If it's a building, then you can post as many pictures as you'd like while retaining all rights as long as you stay on publicly accessible land (i.e. don't get a ticket nor sign/agree to any contract that allows you access to the building). It's murky what your rights are if it's considered a building and you agree to the contract."
"If it's a sculpture, you have close to 0 rights in photographing it."
"The T&C are related to ticket purchases, so none of this would be relevant if you're just taking pictures of it from publicly accessible land anyway."
It's murky what your rights are if it's considered a building and you agree to the contract.
"No, it isn't. A contract is a contract."
Contracts can be invalid though in certain situations (such as they include illegal things)
Yes. These aren't.
Is that legal?
Reminds me of the burning man festival and photos.
"Sure, why wouldn't it be? The general status of private property access contracts is that you're free to not agree to it if you don't like it."
"Which, at least if you're a commercial photographer, you probably shouldn't."
Legal for them to ask you to sign the waiver but doubtful if it will hold up in court if challenged.
No signature. You assume to agree to the waiver by getting a ticket.
Did you read the entire waiver? These are used as deterrents from people suing. They rarely hold up in court.
There’s numerous sources like the one below:
"“Just because an agreement contains an arbitration provision, does not automatically mean the dispute will be arbitrated, or that (if arbitrated) the arbitration award will be enforced."
"For example, in Atalese v. U.S. Legal Services Group, L.P. (2014), the New Jersey Supreme Court stated that having favored status does not mean every arbitration clause will be enforceable. It added that the preference for arbitration is not without limits; an arbitration agreement may be invalidated by generally applicable state-law contract defenses. Applying such defenses, the court proceeds to find the provision unenforceable: “The absence of any language in the arbitration provision that plaintiff was waiving her statutory right to seek relief in a court of law renders the provision unenforceable.”"
"It explained that an agreement to arbitrate, just as with any contract, “must be the product of mutual assent, as determined under customary principles of contract law.” The court made it clear that a party is not required to arbitrate an issue when it has not agreed to do so. The court went on to state that for mutual assent, the party must have an understanding of the terms to which they have agreed. It observed that an average member of the public may not realize that arbitration is a substitute to one’s right to have a claim addressed in a court of law. Hence, it is necessary that the contract language be sufficient to place the signer on notice that he or she is waiving a constitutional or statutory right to trial. The Atalese court noted that the arbitration agreement at issue was located on page nine of a twenty-three page contract. Further, the clause did not explain what arbitration was, how it differs from a trial by jury, or that the right to a trial was being waived.  The court ruled the agreement violated a basic principle of contract law and was therefore unenforceable.”"
I think I know a thing or two about contract law. Feel free to Google my username if it confuses you.
‘Oi do you ave a loicense to be takin pictures of the Vessel?’
I have tickets for a couple weeks from now. Thank you for pointing this out to me. I don’t even want to go anymore. Doesn’t seem to be a point.
"If I’m going to take photos of a space I want those photos to belong to me,  or the space."
did you plan to make money with photos you take there?
"I didn't, but I don't see why that matters."
"Photography is a skill and should be paid for. I don't work for them, there is no WFH agreement here. If they want marketing photos they can hire someone to take marketing photos. They should not be grabbing my own rights to images I take there or take of the space. If they want to do that, they can pay me, but I'm absolutely not going to let them take photos I capture for free."
"By telling me that they can use my likeness or personal photos for marketing purposes without compensation, they're devaluing me, my time, and photographs. I would rather spend my time doing things for corporations that don't devalue me in such ways."
Guess I’ll bring my film camera there.
How would that help
How can they get my negatives?
They can't get pictures stored in your phone that you never post either
""
Stupid. They’re gonna have people from other universes exploiting their creations
Im already over this hideous hunk of metal.
I don't get it. Do you have to sign this waiver before taking a picture? No? Then why would anyone be held liable for anything?
""
"Yeah, but most of people taking pictures (including myself who went over the weekend) didn't have tickets. I didn't agree to anything. No contract signed implicitly or explicitly."
"Yeah, but most of people taking pictures (including myself who went over the weekend) didn't have tickets."
Doesn't matter if you had tickets or not.
OR ENTERS THE VESSEL EXPERIENCE
"To be honest, a pro photographer visiting this place is going to be overwhelmed by the amount of tourists standing around, any photo taken here would be a tough sell. Not to mention, like most touristy places, the return on the sale of said photo would be minimal at best when there are going to be a ton of pictures to choose from. And if you plan on shooting this for stock photos, good luck... Most buildings do not allow it without written permission, and they rarely give it up."
"We live in a social media world now. Photography isn't what it used to be. I have lost many sales because my price was higher than the guy with a cell phone giving away his work for free, and not because I feel my work is cell phone quality, but because free almost always wins. And when I go shooting popular spots, I encounter armies of photographers at varying skill levels, all climbing over each other for the same shot. Many of which will give it away for fifteen minutes of fame. So I don't really shoot things like this much anymore, and if I do I don't expect a payout unless my shot is as unique as possible."
At what point will ticketing stop and you can go to the Vessel whenever you want?
"They did this with The Bean in Chicago. If you set up a tripod and started taking what looked like professional photos, you were ticketed. One guy was so pissed off that they had to take him in. I think he sued and won."
They don't seem to bug people any more.
Intellectual Property isn't property.
.....right....
"As shitty as it is, it's private property, and if you want access, you need to abide by their terms. Don't want to? Don't buy a ticket."
"Don't point out that it was paid in conjunction with public funds and tax breaks, it's still private property."
Are you a Libertarian?
"no. I'm a NYC real estate guy. I said, it's a shitty policy, but it's their Vessel. Don't like it, don't go."
"I was just pointing out that it's not public land, nobody can make up implied rights that don't exist.  It's like a baseball game, you buy the ticket, you consent to being on TV."
"no. I'm a NYC real estate guy. I said, it's a shitty policy, but it's their Vessel. Don't like it, don't go."
"You can make the same argument to almost every private property in NYC with the same shitty policies If that's the case, I don't see any reason why we can't change it."
"Yeah, private property that was heavily subsidized to the tune of several millions of public dollars."
"They paid 25 billions for the area and  it's time to get some money back. The vessel/nest/maze/pinecone, or whatever the name will be, is an open air structure. Made of stairs. They simply want to avoid the daily list of people sueing HY for being slipped or fallen."
"Regarding the photos and potential nicknames, well,  they spent that money, this they could afford to pay few bucks to someone with a brilliant shot or idea, but let's say that all those billions give you the ability to hire good attorneys"
"I'd like to ask to those 21 downvoters whether they think that HY is an opportunity for NYC to grow like, or even better, what might have been the (already-gone) Amazon HQ."

"Did you expect nice services, buildings, infrastructures for free?"

Are you all pro-photographers?

Or just a bunch of resenting people?
