Lol. Nicely done
Idk about suicide rates in general but I imagine the rate of someone jumping off something is pretty high. My first real job in the city “grew up in outter Boroughs” during the first week I seen this dude jump off the roof of a building on the upper east side. Well me and about 100 other people on the street seen it. I looked all over the internet for the next week to read the story about it. Wasn’t mentioned on any website/paper. I think they try to sweep shit like that under the rug. And if this kid didn’t jump off something as eyes on as the vessel we’d prop never hear of it.
"Suicides really aren’t newsworthy usually. I met a crime scene investigator once. He said that whenever he would go somewhere for a scene, local media would show up and as soon as he said “suicide” they’d just leave with no further questions."
Someone jumped in the East River yesterday from the Queens side yesterday and drowned. I was there when he jumped and saw his body getting pulled out. I haven't seen it on any news sites so can confirm
It’s the idea to not give individuals notoriety for doing the deed.
"Sure but it’s also just not newsworthy. It’s very common, sadly."
Newspapers and new channels avoid mentioning suicides due to copycats.
"Ironically, the possibility of jumping off the Vessel never crossed my mind until reading this headline."
They don’t want to draw attention to it to prevent people from jumping that just want their names in the headlines.

Copycat suicide
A copycat suicide is defined as an emulation of another suicide that the person attempting suicide knows about either from local knowledge or due to accounts or depictions of the original suicide on television and in other media.
"A spike of emulation suicides after a widely publicized suicide is known as the Werther effect, following Goethe's novel The Sorrows of Young Werther.The publicized suicide serves as a trigger, in the absence of protective factors, for the next suicide by a susceptible or suggestible person. This is referred to as suicide contagion. They occasionally spread through a school system, through a community, or in terms of a celebrity suicide wave, nationally."
""
"Very low due to a good economy (not that you would know it from Reddit, but it's true) and the lack of easy access to guns, which is the most successful method of suicide."
"Don't read Reddit and think you're getting an accurate picture of the city, because you're not. Redditors only post the most inflammatory and negative articles."
"You may feel that way, but it's not accurate. That's what I'm saying - don't go by the picture that Reddit is trying to paint for you. Go by statistics."
"I can't find a city by city comparison, but the New York State suicide rate is 8.4 per hundred thousand. In Montana it's 29.7."
Thank you for the stats!

I found the NYC rate for you.
https://nyshc.health.ny.gov/web/nyapd/suicides-in-new-york
"At 6.3 per hundred thousand in 2017, it's even lower than the state overall. This also confirms your 8.4 per hundred thousand rate (as of 2017)."
""
"But it's not surprising the city is lower than the state - the rest of the state isn't doing very well, economically speaking."
"That’s interesting, sure im seeing this story but i feel like every day someone else is throwing themselves in front of trains and delaying my commute"
"Sure but in a city of 8 million people and assuming a suicide a day, having 365 suicides a year would be a fraction of a percent."
Every day? That’s hyperbolic
"That’s a gross exaggeration and you know it, proving The other guy’s point"
"In 2016, there were 359 suicides among men. In 2015, there were 552 suicides in total."
"Nationwide the trend has been upwards. So, there's certainly enough people dying every year for 1 person a day killing themselves (speaking purely in terms of statistics, of course)."
https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/about/press/pr2018/pr036-18.page
"According to a September 2018 article in the NY Times, there were a total of around 43 incidents that were suicides or attempted suicides (or about 0.8 incidents a week per year) in 2017."
Why would you make some shit like that up ?
I would imagine that a high number of people travel here to commit suicide. It’s morbid but sometimes people want to commit suicide at a specific landmark and we are full of landmarks.
There was a documentary years ago about people who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge and I was surprised how many people traveled from quite far away to kill themselves there.
Great documentary too.
I would imagine that a high number of people travel here to commit suicide.
Ding ding ding.
"He was identified as being from New Jersey, attending attending college in Connecticut."
"Hmm, I don't think anyone has jumped off the Empire State Building since March 2010."
We're doing good!
RIP. I'm just surprised that this is the first time this happened
"Me too,  I look at it all the time and think it looks easy for someone to fall off"
"This is really sad, but I am also surprised it took so long."
"I unfortunately knew the young man very well,"
"If anyone has any additional detail or insights from the scene please let me know. A beautiful, well spoken, and kind young man and the family is absolutely destroyed.  I really don’t even know what to say or ask, but any type of answer would help. I’ve always read these headlines and scrolled by, but it is such a strange feeling knowing that my world is turned upside down and this is just another story to most (which I completely understand). Please take the time and reach out to those you wouldn’t expect, and if you feel that bad please please thing about the people who love you."
"I really don’t even know what to say or ask, but any type of answer would help."
There isn't any one-size-fits-all answer I am afraid.
"I can tell you that a common thread between people like Kate Spade (who had family, wealth, and friends) and poor farmers in Africa is despair."
In the mind of someone wanting to kill themselves there is no relation between the world inside their mind and the world outside of it. There is only the sad desperate conviction that ending one's life is the right thing to do.
"The only bleak comfort I can offer is that sometimes when people decide they're going to do it there is nothing that will change their mind, and there is nothing you could have done differently. They may have even done their best to convince you they were doing fine."
I am sorry for your loss. 19 is an especially tragic age.

"i wish this young man's soul well. it sounds like he was troubled before the end. however without any specific identifications, reaching out to those who i woulnt' expect would just make things worse. what can i do to truly reach them, and if I wasn't expecting it how can I even know who to reach out to. If I reached out to all of them, they'd think there's something wrong with me."
You’re absolutely right. I have no clue what the big takeaway or “lesson” from all of this is. It’s just very very sad and I wish there was some way to easily identify people with these feelings and help them.
"I've known a number of men who were depressed and even when they didn't talk about it, it was very clear that their mood was disturbed. If you're depressed (especially to the point of being suicidal), it's difficult to maintain a perfect facade with people you're close to and/or are in contact with on a regular basis."
"If you don't see someone often, they may be able to fool you for brief amounts of time, or if they're acting down, you're likely to chalk it up as a bad day and not how they feel all the time. Not to mention that men are less likely to ask other men to talk about their feelings."
Men often express depression differently than women - they're more likely to act out aggressively and more likely to self-medicate with drugs or alcohol. So in many cases it may appear that they're angry when they're actually depressed.
"If you're really interested, the city offers a free ""mental health first aid"" class."
https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/mental-health-first-aid.page
"ETA: Don't try to be a therapist for your friends, though. Be there for them and be willing to listen, but don't try to ""therapize"" them. That's a great way to destroy your relationship and bring you down with them. Encourage them to seek professional help, even go with them to the therapist's office if you think they won't go alone."
"Very well spoken, this seems like the only way to obtain some sort of positive value out of this situation. You’re truly a good person for taking the time to type this all out for a stranger you didn’t know. Very cool, thank you"
"honestly, apart from identifying them I have no idea what to say to them to truly reach out. often i ask, 'are you alright?' and their canned response is 'yea' and that's the end of it."
"It's okay to be more forceful about it and ask specific and probing questions. And if they still insist nothing's wrong, then you wrap it up by saying, all right, but if you ever want to talk, I'm here for you."
Tragic. RiP
"The first suicide. Unfortunately, it was only a matter of time. Go see the vessel soon because they're definitely going to incorporate safeguards for this."
I'm surprised it took this long.
Thank God he didn’t land on someone and kill them.
Literally the first thing I said when I saw this thing: that somebody’s gonna jump from it. Sad.
Damn dude that’s sad af.
That must have been shocking for all the tourists there to witness
I hope this doesn't cause an overreaction requiring the placement of oversized fences and safety nets. Unlikely but you never know.
"It's not as if people who are hellbent on killing themselves couldn't just leap off a bridge, walk into the FDR, an incoming subway train, or one of the many tall buildings in the city. The point is, it was simply a matter of time until someone did it. I'm just glad no one else got hurt."
So young!! What was troubling this poor young man! RIP.
"i've yet to even go there. i'd still like to go visit, but it won't be the same."
Any body else present when this happened.
"I was standing in the square but on the opposite side so I was fortunate not to have to see the event, however the sound is haunting me. So young. I'm having a tough time coping. So sorry to this guy's folks and anyone who witnessed it."
Nets on the lower level might help.
"If someone wanted to kill themselves, they will just find another way."
"China isn't intrinsically pro-suicide, you ignoramus."
You mean doesn't*?
Didn't they expect this and put up barriers? It's careless that they didn't
"Unfortunately one day you’ll be close to someone with an unfortunate end like this, and I hope that nobody is this blatantly callous towards your loved one as you were to this guy. But well done, I hope you got to chuckle and count your points or whatever."
"Their language might be insensitive, but they're not wrong."
"We often criticize people who choose to commit suicide by train or bus because they are likely to traumatize the driver (and possibly any bystanders). Someone who commits suicide in a public place is harming others, and there's never a justification for that."
Cool
Time for safety nets
"Saying that you were suicidal isn’t a great way to justify your insensitivity towards the ending of a young mans life. Dark humor is fine and can be enjoyable, but hopefully it comes with the understanding that there is a community of people that were completely devastated last night."
Not “jumping down your throat” but being suicidal yourself doesn’t earn you some special pass to be cruel or fish for internet points. Hopefully you’ve gotten the help you need and can find joy in things other that the misery of another persons death.
"Fair enough, to each his own. Honestly do hope that you are doing well though. Clearly just unmanaged frustration on my end."
I appreciate the goodwill vibes. I would call mine “mismanaged frustration”. Def something I need to work on.
Apologies for the saltiness.
It’s art. Do you find a painting to be useless? Do you not consider architecture art?
"It's kind of ugly art, to be honest. If I were trapped in a museum with just one artwork in it for all of eternity I'd rather have a Monet (or, fuck, even a Rothko) than whatever the fuck this thing is."
"You’re absolutely entitled to your opinion that it’s ugly art. However, art still has a purpose - You and I are now talking about it."
Putting something in the sphere of public discourse does not make it art.
"I'm not sure why you added ""However, art still has a purpose"" when I said absolutely nothing to the contrary."
"This thing certainly does have a purpose. It's an expression of the hubris of the mega rich, and the tiers of class in society. It is an embodiment of the myth that we can all ascend to the top and look down on others making their way up. And it's fucking ugly as fuck."
It is quite possibly Heatherwick's worst executed idea in his entire career.
Seriously? Do we have to do the definition thing here?  Do people not know what art is?  Do people really thing only the Mona Lisa is art while a 10 year old’s drawing isn’t?
Anything made for creative purposes is art. Bad art is art and Bad art is only bad because some people say it is.
art /ärt/ noun
"the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture."
"I have a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. So, please, fucking spare me."
""
"Maybe, but if that's what you derived from my comments you need to read better."
Anything made for creative purposes is art.
"I respectfully disagree with you there. A computer can create music. It is not art, however. We're entering an age of AI where the algorithm is not sentient but will still be able to produce works that fool us into thinking there was sentience behind the creation of that work. I would never consider such a thing to be art."
If there is no special element of personal expression involved in the creation of the work then it is not art.
"Anyway, no here so far has said The Vessel isn't art."
"When I wrote,"
Putting something in the sphere of public discourse does not make it art.
"it was referring specifically to the claim that it's art because people are talking about it. If it is not yet clear, let me explain that I can say something is art yet say it is not because it is being talked about while acknowledging that it can be art for other reasons. Usually people in English speaking countries figure out the nuances to such sentence constructions in elementary school. I can only assume you are not from an English speaking country. Or perhaps you hit REPLY before you had your cup of coffee, and volunteered your wisdom on a complex subject without fully grasping what the fuck you were reading."
"...aaaaaand the dictionary still disagrees with you, despite your long sentences."
(Tell Webster’s about your bachelor’s degree!!! They’ll be sure to change the definition of the word!)
""
"Your degree is pretty useless if you can't see the art in the Vessel. Somebody designed it and put their personal expression on it, just because you can't see it doesn't mean it's not art."
Hideous and creepy looking af
Just because it’s art doesn’t mean it’s good or even worthwhile.
Whether or not it’s good are is not the point. You said it serves no purpose. It’s art. Art itself has a purpose.
"If you don’t understand the purpose of art, I’m not gonna get into that conversation today."
"Well you certainly don’t have a clue and appear to have made up some nonsensical definition of art.  The Vessel is not art, certainly not because “someone was creative.”  Tell me the antecedents to the Vessel and its place in the discussion among actual artists about the purpose of art and the role of the artist and you might be able to make an argument in its favor that I’m not seeing."
Incorrect. If you see my other comment I copied the definition from Google.
"If dictionary definitions are nonsensical definitions, Your problem is with the dictionary, not me."
Just because you were suicidal doesn't make you any less of an insensitive asshole
"funny, but just a weeeeeeeeeeee bit too soon, y'know?"
It will always be too soon.

What about protecting other people from falling bodies?
Same deal. It's not a common enough occurrence. The chances of being hit by a falling body in this space are so astronomically low as to not warrant further investigation.
"""I don't know anything about it, but I'm aggin' it, daggum!"""
Where's that reference from?
It's hideous. Something really creepy looking about it.
