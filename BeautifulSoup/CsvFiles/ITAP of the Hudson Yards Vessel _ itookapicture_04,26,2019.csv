"Technically speaking, they claim to own any images of it. It's in the fine print somewhere."
Yep. It's posted when you walk in.
but it's in public....
"It's not. It's on private property, where the public is allowed."
"that means it's effectively in public. they can put up a sign and say whatever they want, but they don't own all photos taken of the building. maybe, just maybe, they can make some sort of claim of violating terms of use by taking pictures of the building while on their property, but the building is visible from a public street so they don't legally own the copyright to all images of the building."
Thats interesting to know
"And now, because you posted it on here, they own Reddit. Damn it!"
Damnit! :)
That was my plan all along ðŸ¤”
What is it?
Itâ€™s an art installation thatâ€™s free entry. Cool structure.
NYCâ€™s latest tourist trap
Nice Composition. What lens?
"iphone xs, no filter"
Very M.C. Escher!
I hate this building
Why?
"They put some art in their horrendous billionaires row and itâ€™s this giant mess of nothing... to me at least. Sorry if Iâ€™m being judgy. I actually think it looks cool, itâ€™s just if only it were for a better purpose."
"I think the purpose of it is to draw people in to shop and/or to publicize the mall. The free tickets are timed. When i went, the tickets were 2.5 hrs later. So what else to do but go to the shops?"
"I love it. Sorry Kansas, itâ€™s not a grain silo."

Joke 'em if you can't take a picture!
public art that is insulting to people who can't climb stairs and bafflingly boring to people who can.
Thereâ€™s an elevator
"yes, there is an elevator, but it's hard to deny that the structure is all about the stairs."
Yea
