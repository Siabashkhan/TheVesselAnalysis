"Stairs to nowhere, but fancier"
screw the haters the vessel is great!
It's all of Hudson yards in general that gets the hate. It's a bunch of wealthy investors buying property and sitting on it. Makes the rest of rent go up.
I'm still not sure I like it but it doesn't matter if I like it or not. Its a public piece of art in a park built over a railyard. There's no reason to hate on it. Whatever you think of Hudson Yards (I actually mostly enjoy the sleek futuristic architecture) you have to agree its better than what was there before.
I love the Vessel.
"I, too enjoy the massive honeycomb"
Its actually a giant shwarma....
"It's very Vaporwave - ""Ascend atop our lattus of stairs to no destination and gaze over the splendid views of New York's finest shopping malls."""
Can we at least agree The Vessel is a dumb name?
Much prefer The Giant Shawarma.
Deus Ex vibes
Cue the theme
The Vessel is not my personal fave but it would actually be pretty cool if it was on the hudson greenway and actually gave you some kind of view rather than just the ability to look in the windows of a mall.
"Wondering how all of this works out now with COVID... is it a ghost town, or are people still out and about? Might pay a visit..."
"Was around on saturday evening to check out the lights and was definitely pretty packed, maybe not pre-Covid Times Square packed, but close."
Fuck hudson yards
I used to work there it isn't as great as it seems
"what better, hudson yards or brookfield place?"
Brookfield place is more to scale and has the marina. My two biggest issues with Hudson Yards (pre-covid) are that the courtyard feels so sterile and the entire complex is cut off from the rest of the city.
"If they add some outdoor cafes and street-front stores to browse without first entering the mall, I think the courtyard would be a lot more successful. However, I wish they tried to incorporate the complex into the city fabric, rather than plopping the towers without providing a true sense of place."
Yea they want no part of ‚Äúcity people‚Äù or being part of the fabric of NYC.
"Brookfield Place, better food, better scenery being right on the water, more integrated into the surrounding area."
Mr Schirripi likes Wei West
That whole area is a travesty to nyc.
"He's right btw. It's a wasted opportunity. Sure the Vessel is nice and so is The Edge, but the mall is boring and copy and pasted from Brookfield Place, Columbus Circle, etc with the exact same chains you can find everywhere else. Now with no Neiman Marcus as well as some of the boutiques and restaurants, so it's already a dead mall as it is. The Shed is not a real and proper concert and event venue. Instead it's a glorified exhibition hall with a handful of very highbrow exhibitions that were totally inaccessible to the average person, so that too is a money loser."
More condos for the super rich that will sit empty for the forseeable future as tax shelters. Ditto for the offices. And its costing the city money. $1 billion in tax breaks and subsidies to cover the cost of the 7 train extension that's now leaving a hole of $2billion that needs to be paid off.
"It should have been like a co-op city for middle income and/or millennials looking to buy for the first time. Income limited HDFC coops, with income levels from 80-160% of AMI and larger apartments so families (who now need to work and school from home) which is what this city really needs built. The Shed should put on shows that bring in teenagers from Queens too. Instead of another boring mall with the same stores, it should have been a Reading Terminal styled food court or a proper green space/park or like Chicago's Millennium Park with the Vessel as an anchor."
Genuinely curious what the other alternatives would have been.
"Btw, a lot of companies relocated to Hudson Yards - CNN being a major one."
I mentioned it in the latter half of my comment. Saying again: More affordable housing. A Chicago style Millennium Park. A proper concert hall.
Companies relocating there means nothing now since most of them are going to be WFH for the foreseeable future.
"If you had actually read my comment, you would've seen the alternatives that should have been built instead of this. But if repeating ""barren (the correct spelling) and empty for decades"" over and over makes you feel good...."
"You posted a pic but then seemed to hold an agenda that Hudson Yards is one of the best achievements to come to the city. It is one of the most short-sighted, useless urban planning endeavors to happen."
"You know what this city needs? More green, open space."
You know what this city doesn't need? More malls and stupid artifacts.
Dang you‚Äôve spoiled my master plan!
They were sitting on it for high end space specifically. Manhattan needs no more as wealthy already cleared out
Thank you.
The whole area is owned by wealthy investors that don't even live in nyc. It causes all rent to go up because they are parking money.
It‚Äôs still a soulless wasteland. And no tourist is coming to NYC to shop at HY.
"Yeah, still not going there."
Okay.
Thanks for letting me know. That will make me not go either.....
Cool ... no one asked you to lol; was simply posting something that I think looked nice all lit up üôÉ
What the fuck. I‚Äôve never seen this building. Can‚Äôt wait to visit!
"Its just a bunch of stairs and staircases. Go to The Edge instead, especially after sunset. Beautiful views. Tickets are $36."
You have to pay $36 to climb stairs?
"Lol nah, the Vessel which is what is pictured is free, but you do have to sign up for a time slot ahead of time. The Edge is a new skyscraper with a glass platform you can walk on that is also in the Hudson Yards area."
"If you have an issue with heights, I advise against it.  I was fine except for the glass floor"
I believe you pay to ride the elevator
"Hudson Yards an the Vessel. An empty piece of spectacle consumerism amounting to the architectural, artistic, and urbanistic equivalent of a packet of pop rocks. Built on land that could‚Äôve instead been used for something truly pioneering, altruistic, poetic and for the public. Gone are the days of Carrere and Hastings‚Äô NYPL, McKim Meade and White‚Äôs Penn Station, or even Mies van der Rohe‚Äôs Seagram building. Or William Lescaze‚Äôs experimental and optimistic public housing projects. Today we get this and say ‚Äúthat‚Äôs cool.‚Äù"
Lol born and bred New Yorker here bruh
Patagonia wearing sweetgreen lunching one?
Bored as hell on a conference call.
Someone's poor.
"I wish, quite in vogue today.  Also, poor people don't study kant.  Check the tag my friend."
This is some ignorant bullshit right here
"I know the guy that did the glass railing around that strange thing you see there. It‚Äôs called the Occulus. The amount of precision and craftsmanship that goes into doing something like that is insane, lots of respect for the guy."
"This is The Vessel in Hudson Yards, the Oculus is at the World Trade Center."
"Hmmm, do they look the same?"
"Edit:whoops, yeah my mistake. He had mentioned doing it last winter, and showed me pictures. Ah, well, mistakes were made!"
So sterile and charmless.
