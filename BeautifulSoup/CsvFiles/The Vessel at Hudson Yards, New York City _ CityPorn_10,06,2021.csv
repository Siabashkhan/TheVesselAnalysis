"Now closed indefinitely, due to reoccurring suicudes"
Goddammit. This is why we can't have anything nice.
"It isn't nice, it's a garish attempt to recreate ""interact with the city"" vibe of the Bean in Chicago. A $250 million boondoggle. They should tear it down already."
Lmao I think it looks cool
Sucks that people were attempting to kill themselves on it but it's far from worth tearing down
"Haha I love your pessimistic comment and to each their own opinion on art. But in actuality it’s kinda true though, this is what happens when you allow a major city to become a playground only the rich can afford as an investment, rather than a community for all. Hudson yards within the scope of modern urban planning values is a joke. I’d personally rather see the investment go directly to the less fortunate population rather than fancy unnecessary parks on floating tulips build by billionaires. (Cue the eye roll.)"
"That's so cool! I was in NYC recently, got a picture, but couldn't access the center (I'm really hoping it's not because of the suicide thing mentioned in the other comment)."

"It's also ignorant and selfish for building designers and rich decision makers to build a publicly accessible building without proper safeguards in place to prevent suicides, or at least prevent harm to passers-by."
"We need to stop shaming individuals, who are victims to these large systems, and start shaming those who keep society at a place where suicide seems like a better option than living"
"I've seen this in ""Heart for takeaway"" by the chain smokers music video."
Cool
Woah that’s trippy!
