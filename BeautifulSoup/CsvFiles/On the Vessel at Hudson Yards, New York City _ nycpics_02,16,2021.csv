Thought they closed this because of the deaths?
"They did, back in January.  This photo was taken in last year."
Ok. Can't believe all those stairs...great pic.
Thank you.
"Yeah, the stairs go in all direction and seem to never end. Once you are inside the Vessel though everything looks rather surreal."
"Think it'll open again? I can't believe they didn't think of the risks during the design phase... oh well. Oh, and to charge to walk around it... oh well."
"I'm sure it will reopen before the summer. There are several preventive measures under consideration so most likely by the summer this will be open again (it has to open, it is a major tourist attraction)"
"I wouldn't say major, but I would say the newest. That alone may push the reopening."
