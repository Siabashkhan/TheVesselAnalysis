"In my head, the observation decks look exactly like The Vessel."
"Instead of cities stacked on top of each other, it's in fact a planet-city. A continuous urban landscape encompassing the surface and the underground. So, indeed, there are stacked levels and endless corridors. Also, the only green areas are at the imperial palace and the university."

"Hmm, that low income housing might be a tad bit too breezy in the winter."
"The Thomas Heatherwick-designed structure, which has stairs climbing 150 feet in the air, has been described by architecture and design writers as a “mythical giant’s wastepaper basket,” “a colossal shawarma,” “an Instagram-friendly panopticon,” and what you would get “if Twitter were a work of architecture.”"
I think it looks cool but wow it does look like shawarma from a distance
I can see it

"Oh shit, it actually does. Search for image of shawarma on the rotisserie and you'll see it."
Trompo
It's also pointless and hardly ADA accessible. It's like NYC trying desperately to find a way of one upping the Bean in Chicago.
....there's an elevator
This is what we have in nyc instead of affordable housing. Cool
"Any art project funded with money earmarked for low income housing, like the vessel in Hudson Yards."
Can you send me an article about this? Haven't heard this before.

There ya go.
"Dang, this is fucked.  That map showing how they linked Harlem to Hudson Yards is a complete joke."
That being said it seems like this is an issue with the New York government than the developer since the federal government leaves the determination of opportunity zones to the local government
How much do you want to bet some we’ll find some suspicious donations to the politicians that approve the opportunity zones.  Hopefully someone is looking into that

"I loved the High Line and visited it a lot when I lived in NYC, despite living on the east side."
That said...the reason this exists is totally beyond me.
Walked by this once.. what's it for anyway?
"It was used by the city as a way to direct funding away from low income housing and instead to a vanity project they could use to say they're making the city more beautiful and friendly. It's only for tourists to go to, climb up, get a picture, then go do something more interesting."
I absolutely hate it.
Pointless piece of garbage
I hate this pretentious monstrosity. It should be in Dallas. Not the city. An empty vessel it is though.
Hey now! You got something to say about our pretentious monstrosities?!?!?!?!
"You're right though, Dallas would love it."
"Vapid and empty, seems symbolic..."
Sums up the entire Hudson Yards development
But what's it even for
"Bingo, it's a lame attempt to replicate the success of the Bean sculpture in Chicago. The Bean was an instant hit as it gave tourists the perfect backdrop for city skyline selfies right at the advent of the selfie era. NYC saw this phenom and wanted desperately to have a similar, but of course ""bigger and better"", piece of public art. So they built this outrageous monument to wasteful spending."
"For reference the Bean went massively over budget and still only cost $23 million, entirely donated funds. The Vessel cost over $200 million and sucks."
"doubt that it really costs 200 million, it was probably just a venture to line the pockets of city officials while disguising it as something like you said."
"and the fact that every piece was fabricated , assembled, disassembled in Italy and then shipped and reassembled In ny"
"Anything to put a ""made in"" sticker on it."
"so tourists can walk up a staircase and feel like their doing something ""trendy"""
"An expensive waste of space, instead of a nice park with maybe a monument, a fountain or some work of art they decided to make this."
I can see that one may find it too expensive but is this not art?
"As someone in the design world, this is incredibly disrespectful and diminutive of the work and care and time put into different forms of art. Art is art, period. So show some respect for others, even if it’s just online."
"I partially agree with you. For the original question “is it art?” (or rather what was a sad attempt at patronizing those who do this for a living) the answer is yes, and while not everyone can or will appreciate every piece of art in existence, it’s still art."
"For the rest: Does it add value? Was it the correct allocation of funds? Is it fundamentally a “good” piece? And all those, there’s a much more complex set of answers. I’m deeply upset to see that someone I look up to would accept a project with seeming knowledge of the people he’s effectively displacing. I’m upset at the location choice, a heavily populated city where it’s only purpose is very blatantly to accumulate wealth. There’s obviously a lot more too it, but this is the kind of conversation that teaches and informs and helps people build knowledge, even if they don’t appreciate the work."
"Why? Why is it “garbage”? I would agree that it’s not my preferred interpretation, sure, but the work created by those with thought and care are not just garbage. Have you ever taken the time to really look into a piece of art? Like truly listen to the history of it, the muse, the cause, the emotion? Any one of those things can make it beautiful. Colour theory and symmetry are other beautiful expressions of math and light. Don’t discount or speak poorly or the things you don’t understand."
"Sure it's kinda cool looking but they fucking charge you money to walk up steps. It's not a public monument, you have to fucking pay to walk up it."
it is free
"Oh. I stand corrected. Last time I was there I saw you needed tickets and I guess i either assumed it cost money or someone told me it cost money, but yeah upon googling you right"
Beautiful....but many redundancies?
"sometimes redundancy is nice. one staircase or elevator to the top would eliminate “redundancies” as you call them, but where’s the fun in that?"
What exactly is the point of this thing other than being a massive waste of resources?
How many steps to the top?
Trash
Vessel bad
Affordable housing good

Alien communications
Oh grow up.
It's a signal amplifier for the underground lizard people.
Are you sure it’s not an antenna for the CIA’s mind control program?
"No, those tend to lose signal strength because they're affected by the ""heaven energies"" pushing them down, so they need to put those high up."

Don't throw my boy Escher under the bus.
I can agree with this.
I love this. Its a very creative high-density meeting place. its interesting

You’d think that would have occurred to the designer right off the bat but I guess not
