All I see is shawarma. They really have to raise these barriers.
Looks exactly like shawarma
If you're Mexican it's Pastor.
"There's probably an optimum height for a structure to be attractive as a suicide method (high enough to guarantee death whilst low enough to minimize the time spent in abject terror), and this inverted pine cone or French pastry or whatever the fuck it's supposed to be is that exact height."
"The height you’re looking for is 7 stories. The Vessel is 16 stories. Low guardrail height and a lack of people at night probably has something to do with it, but I haven’t been and can’t speak from experience."
The good news is you can get off the Vessel on any story you choose
"In the city where investment bankers lept from skyscrapers during the Depression, they built this big ugly set of stairs that only seem to exist for the express purpose of killing yourself."
“Thousands Turn Out For Empire State Building's Annual No-Hassle Suicide Day” -The Onion
Damn only $15 thats a bargain. When do they go on sale for 2021?
One step closer to suicide booths. Futurama predicted this
"OMG I thought that too, and my partner was like, you're morbid, but I knew it..... and now I read this... wtf... I want to be wrong"
"They’re at least 3.5 feet tall because that’s the code minimum. However, four feet isn’t going to prevent someone from climbing over to jump..."
Edit: height
"Anything tall, man. Golden Gate Bridge sees an average of 30 suicides per year."
"Let’s not pretend like the solution to this problem is getting rid of the vessel or adding a few feet to the glass barrier... suicide prevention starts with targeting mental health, which should be seeing more and more public funding"
Sadly never going to happen. Shithole we live in
"When the mayor’s wife stops sapping funds from the mental health program, maybe."
"Kinda wish I went up it at least once now, might be ugly but still cool construction"
No one planned committing suicide until they saw Hudson Yards.
"Suicide doesn't kill people, tall structures do, or something like that."
The day this shithole gets torn down should be a holiday.
"I have fantasies of how Hudson Yards can be repurposed for the better of New York, but it would just be such an environmental waste to tear it all down while it's an absolute dead ocean as-is."
"I dunno, just make it all housing."
"This is sad... but all things considered, death by shawarma is a pretty baller way to punch your own ticket"
Has anyone ever felt a weird feeling on that building? I could not think straight on it. Then I had a friend tell me that they  had a possessive feeling on the building as well.
This looks like the type of structure where some guy shaped this to sacrifice people to summon cthulu or something in a movie
Good. It's ugly as hell.
It’s closed not demolished. Sell ugly
I didn't think it had been pulled down. I wish they would.  Fat chance.
Please dump it in the river now. It's already the ugliest thing in the city; now it's the most depressing and ugliest.
"I thought that until I actually saw it up close and climbed to the top.  At dusk, its beautiful, but hey, to each his own"
"I have been there a few times, because, when you’re bored and ride your bike everywhere, you end up in any place you know you hate because “it’s something to do,” and I stand by my statement. It’s gross and everything around it is gross."
K
Demolish it
"As someone in Indiana (whose dream it is to move to New York City, that’s why I joined this sub), I think this structure is pretty cool. . ."
"I hope you can achieve your dream someday, but there are a lot better places in NYC, trust me. And most of them were built without stealing from New Yorkers."
"Seriously. I mean, I have killed myself in wayyyy better spots"
Thank you :”)
Different strokes for different folx! <3 I hope your dream comes true.
I aaaaalllways thought this place was a dumb idea. We can't have nice things these days.
"Ever travel cross country and you'd see a billion billboards for some crappy poorly thought-out tourist trap like ""the world's largest peach stand!"" and you go there and you realize that it's just an underwhelming gas station with a giant peach-shaped structure behind it made of plywood?"
"Imagine if someone made a lattus of staircases going nowhere and was like ""come to the world's tallest staircase!"" but then some Manhattan dipshit bought it, covered it with rose-gold chrome because they thought that's what millennials would like, and stuck it in the middle Manhattan, only the only thing you can really get a view of is a mall."
And then you pay for it with subsidizes set aside for poor people.

"As a guide, I visited it about 6 times but their free ticketing system is so convoluted that my vendors could never get me a ticket for myself and each time, I'd wait at the bottom while my customers would go up and be down within 20 minutes and state ""that was nice"" which is usually customer code for ""that's dumb."""

tour guide.
What's something good you recommend to tourists in midtown? Never know where to send people visiting.
"I mean, the most generic boilerplate tour for me is"
Central Park -> 5th Ave -> Saint Patrick -> 30 Rock
""
"Like, if I was showing people I like around midtown I'd go to the Schwartzman Library and maybe Grand Central."
"Or, I heard that John Field's ""Brooklyn Bridge Tour, With Yelling"" is worth checking out as it's an action-pack exploration of New York's most famous bridge with over 150 five-star reviews on AirBnB and 3 one-star reviews on TripAdvisor because I fucking hate that platform and forget to close it down for the pandemic so some dipshits from Florida booked one of my tours and I never got an alert because their dashboard is garbage and so they called me up angry and in the rain one random-ass day in the middle of the largest global pandemic in a Century."
"That must be a pretty cool job, meeting people from around the world and showing off your home city. Do you get to show more than Midtown? I know that’s the tourist hotspot but I’m wondering if you get to show other parts of the city off to people or if they only want TV New York."
"Yeah, it’s the best job in the world."
"Student tours were 2/3rd of my income and those are by the discretion of the teachers/parents and 80% of the time it’s that “boilerplate tour” I listed above, but it’s fun because I’m dealing with kids and every group is different and while I always see the same thing all the time, there’s a lot of stimulation when it comes to thinking on your feet and doing things on the fly."
"When I have cool groups or black students, I’ll show them Harlem and the Hamilton house and/or Chinatown and/or FiDi, I think Chinatown is my favorite of that"
"I used to do private tours through vendors, but all the vendors were slow-paying assholes and all the customers were what I call “cruise ship people” who fucking suck, those ones are where id give more personalized tours of wherever but it’s always midtown usually because people don’t know anything about Brooklyn."
I did have a private tour once that was this 72 year old woman who wanted me to show her around downtown Brooklyn so she could see her childhood neighborhood but they were all condos now and it was saaaaad.
"My other 1/3rd of my income was a ticket tour called “Brooklyn Bridge Tour, With Yelling.” I kind of think of tours as being essays you walk through, and this premise was kind of exploring the thesis of what were the “politics of building very big things.”"
"I liked doing it because it was convenient, close to the train line and I got to see the Brooklyn Bridge everyday."
"I don’t really mind doing the same things over and over, I’ve been doing stand up for over eight years now (Jesus) and I think with that, you learn how to be comfortable with repetition and how to squeeze something new out of saying the same thing over and over and over again."
"I kind of am not super motivated  in showing customers stuff outside of “TV New York” partly because I think it’s a little zoo-like and...I dunno, I think a tour is build around “sites” and a neighborhood is a neighborhood- it doesn’t really have as dramatic landmarks unless it’s DUMBO or something."
"Plus, like, I honestly think the job has a lot of artistic integrity but at the same time I’m lazy and don’t want to start from scratch on a spiel and want to do the least amount of work to get to a site and travel among it - talking for 1-3 hours is very exhausting. I didn’t realize how physically draining talking is until I started working there"
this is my favorite description of the vessel I’ve seen. i’m often at a loss for words when i try to describe to people why i hate it so much
The better attraction there is the Little Spain market on the basement of the mall.
it's free.  so i wouldn't call it a tourist trap
They should have read up on the NYU Lbrary before going with this idea.
I worked for this company and while they built this monstrosity I was barely being paid a living wage by NYC standards. Sucks for them I guess.
How about installing some netting in the middle. For the side electrified walls.
