"Hi people of NYC! I’m working on a (totally amateur) landscape architecture project to redesign the Vessel for suicide prevention purpose. 3 young people committed suicide from the Vessel in the past year. While the most straightforward solution would be to build higher railings or enclose the entire structure, I wanted to think beyond that."
"Before I started my research, I had this notion that if someone was suicidal, one enclosed structure would just drive them to go elsewhere to commit suicide, but I was struck by a study by Charlotta Thodelius [at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden] that “younger people commit a different type of suicide from adults. They are spontaneous and act very impulsively. They might not want to actually die, they just want something to stop.”"
"Inspired (and fueled with new-design-student energy), I made my Vessel redesign plans revolve around Thodelius’ idea that “if there are obstacles to taking their own life in these places, there is a high chance that they have no plan B and will abandon the attempt, and after the acute stage of the crisis passes, they may not make another attempt to commit suicide.”"
"Here you’ll see four designs that would either provide people more activities beyond climbing the stairs, or create a space that minimizes the opportunity for one to contemplate death."
"Because the Vessel IRL is Hudson Yards’ private property, it’s not obligated to go through public review before the debut, and it didn’t. I wanted to include that community feedback process in my project. Let me know which one you like or dislike the most, and tell me why - thank you all!!"
Design 1 - A lively bird nest that invites people to look inward (instead of attempting to jump from outward)
Design 2 - The Vessel but staggered differently to provide more points of interest. There is also the hope that the thick tree canopy would introduce a sense of uncertainty to discourage people from jumping off. Arrows indicate directions of eyesight.
Design 3 - A spiral design that encourages a more evenly-distributed flow of people. Think Guggenheim.
"Design 4 - Softening the structure with synthetic fabric, a colorful alternative to tree canopy. The dark background kinda just happened and does not indicate the designer’s preference of any kind.."
"This is so beautiful, i really like 1 & 2. I know many people including myself often feel more relaxed looking at plants - there are scientific studies i think that support this too. I imagine adding plants and trees could be such a small thing that could help someone who is feeling extreme pressure or impulsive, calm down."
I'm one of those people who always thought HY was kinda ugly and I think your designs made me realize it's because there's not enough greenery.
"Thank you for the vote, and I love plants too! I was surprised to read that because Hudson Yards was built over a rail yard that heats up to 150 degrees, they circulate liquid coolants underneath the soil to keep the existing plants alive. It makes the place sound even more artificial, or costly for that matter."
That's interesting to know. Now I wonder if that waste heat can be utilized in some creative or productive manner. It should generate a constant updraft when vented.
"This is such an interesting and thoughtful project to take on, even if it was just for * fun * on your part. I never understood the point of the Vessel and you have some interesting ideas there."
"Thank you - I was hesitant to put my work out there, so this is really encouraging to me!"
"I think it would be effective to put trees, bushes, canopies/tents, and other 'soft' structures on the plaza surrounding the vessel, to make suicide attempts fail. Your design 2 seems to do that."
""
Likely the least intrusive solution is just tall glass walls to keep people in.  It also doubles as preventing objects from being easily thrown and injuring others. The downside is obviously cost.
"Some canopies and tents might be cheaper, but then you get to OP's point: how do you make that not look/feel terrible?  These proposals aren't too bad IMHO.  But I think the Vessel is stupid to begin with, so dressing it up a little for safety is a pretty small ""sacrifice""."
"It doesn't need to actually prevent death, rather it just needs to dissuade jumpers. If there's fairly dense tree cover underneath it won't look as high up at the top, and even if it's just as dangerous people will hesitate because what if the tree breaks your fall and you live, or worse, what if you get impaled on the trees?"
"The suicide research is pretty interesting. There is one area of Washington DC with two bridges very close to one another. People were jumping off the one with the shorter railings. The other bridge had 5 foot railings or something. So then, after many suicides, they decided to raise the railings on the first bridge. After that, people just stopped commiting suicide on those bridges. Having a five foot barrier was too much resistance. You would think that someone who wanted to die could figure it out, but apparently not."
"People also tend to get fixated on a particular way to go. When that ends up not working out, for any reason, they tend to change their minds. So yeah, if you get to the top of the Vessel and it seems like it might not work, there's a good chance it will save lives."
"Actually netting need not cover the whole open area, just about 6-10 feet along the inner perimeter, as it’d be highly improbable to clear the distance by jumping over the railing - which is why it’s done as such on bridges and observatories. Properly designed it might not obstruct too much of the overall view, but also made to tangle the falling person/object so as to prevent or slow further progress."
"True, but that can look more jarring than just going across due to supports you’d need. Compared to anchoring it on the structure itself."
"That’s not necessarily true, because unlike flat or convex perimeters, this being the inner perimeter of a ring, the netting is made taut by a steel belt on the inside (towards center) and a minimal amount (3-6) of wire anchors projecting perpendicular to the ring tangent into the railing or such. Think the iris of your eye requiring no arches or support in the opening (pupil) since the rigidity lays on the outside and inside tension."
Trees may be thin on the part next to the building but I think bushes along the edge could come a long way
Thank you for the vote!!
"Or put fields of 7' tall spikes down, so it's a less attractive option."
"As far as enclosing it as prevention, did you mean both externally and internally? Because sadly Bobst Library at NYU had kids jump into the atrium. Was ultimately solved with brass paneling and plexi walls. Very sad to see remedial architecture of this kind. The tragic cousin of hostile architecture :("
"I was thinking enclosing both sides. Bobst Library kept coming up during my research - so sad indeed. It raises the question that at what point the artistic vision takes a back seat to safety, and I do worry none of my designs truly answers that question.."
The Vessel is hideous. What artistic vision?
I visited Bobst long before the barriers went up. The height and the black and white tiles created a mesmerizing effect.
That’s unreal. Heartbreaking.
I’ve never heard it put that was as being the tragic cousin but that’s such a good descriptor.

"So... as an amateur landscape architect, you should probably know that trees and shrubs need roots. These roots often take up as much space as the tree itself. So not feasible to put any of that stuff on any of the suspended platforms. Even if you can account for a root box, you are adding so much weight to the structure that was not designed for it. Tree in the middle would be cool if this structure was sitting on soil that can be excavated. Pretty sure there is occupied space underneath."
"I dig all of these as a redesign from scratch. Designing is fun, and you are doing a bang up job here!"
"The actual solution to suicide prevention will probably come down to series of cables or glazing panels or a combination of both. It's not hard to pull this off. Trick is to not make it look like a prison yard. Your ideas may have some merit when it comes to concealing the eventual ""cage""."
"Thank you! Root size and weight concern are great points. Currently the trees there grow in an air-conditioned soil because of the heat from underneath, my plan of going ham on the trees would definitely add some complexity to that - doing more research this week and possibly adding some disclaimers in my essay : )"
Pretty sure there is occupied space underneath.
Indeed there is a train yard underneath.
"I would like to suggest that the Vessel is attractive for suicidal people because is it is a literal monument to unnecessary uselessness. The precise feeling that I can presume suicidal people feel, that their life is unnecessary and has no more value. The designer of the Vessel confirms this, saying that inspiration came from a discarded staircase at a demolition site, an object discarded by society and no longer needed."
"Secondarily, it is a monument to gratuitous spending ($200 million build cost) to entertain and boost property values of the rich. I would suggest that today's economic disparity between the rich and everyone else has a good chance of exacerbating a suicidal person's feeling of low self worth."
"Architecture's original definition was the design and construction of buildings, which are inherently essential to our survival, useful and protective. The Vessel is a perversion of the word architecture. The Vessel is simply a large artistic sculpture which uses the vernacular of architecture, but has none of the benefits. I also can't help but feel that the form portrays the idea of climbing but getting nowhere. Other monuments exist without essential or useful purpose, but they almost always have a cultural or commemorative meaning tied to their form."
To call the Vessel Landscape architecture I find even more offensive. Landscape architecture should be even more guided by scientific principals to achieve ecological and humanist intended outcomes.
"The fact that it stands in front of a mall filled with designer brands only adds to the feeling that it’s a monument to unnecessary spending, in my opinion."
"I’m saddened, but not the least bit suprised at the fact that people have jumped from the vessel. I’m a bit confused as to why this wasn’t something they considered when it was designed."
why this wasn’t something they considered when it was designed.
You mean human life and suffering or liability exposure?
If the first was considered it would've never been built.
"the main source of inspiration was the Chand Baori, see here:"
https://www.activemetal.com.au/2018/08/01/stair-inspiration-heatherwicks-vessel-celebrating-innovation-architecture/
"Also in that article : "" Stairs have always been of interest to Heatherwick, and he looks back fondly on his student days when he noticed a set of wooden stairs that had been discarded at a nearby building site. """
"Thanks for bringing up the Chand Baori, I did not know about it before and it is remarkable!"
""
i don't think the uselessness has anything to do with it.  it's a highly visible area and jumping from it makes a statement.  that's all.
""
Here is my critiques of your designs:
""
"Not sure the staggered design does much, you've put the tree on a $200 million pedestal, was that necessary?"
"I'm thinking Guggenheim, and can't help but think that the Guggenheim exists for a very important reason, to house meaningful cultural artifacts. Why does the Vessel exist again?"
"Adds another texture, maybe the fabrics could also be a covert net to catch and swaddle jumpers?"
"I appreciate your thoughts on the Vessel and to be honest you're preaching to the choir. In the accompanying essay I used words like ""bleak vigor"" and ""150-foot tall reminder of corporate wealth"", and wondered what the right tone should be."
"The more I research on this topic, the more skeptical I felt about the Vessel's true value and its intended audience. For that reason I think your point 3 and other comment has a very valid point - if the meaning of a structure is hazy to begin with, is it worthwhile to redefine that meaning?"
I do think that it is worthwhile to redefine the meaning. I think that there may be some way to pull from the significance of the Chand Baori - check this out...
"Chand Baori consists of 3,500 narrow steps over 13 stories. It extends approximately 30 m (100 ft) into the ground, making it one of the deepest and largest stepwells in India."

"I just had the idea that what if Hudson Yards offered $500/day to one musician each day to play live in the center of the Vessel? A million dollars would sustain 2000 days of music, or about 5.5 years..."
these are awesome. What kind of fabric would be used in design four? What would be strong enough
"Spider webs. No one would jump if there were thin layers or webs surrounding the structure in a pattern mimicking that of the vessel itself, such that it appears like a larger cloud form of the vessel"
I actually really like that. Web-like nets for a web-like structure.
"Thank you! My original (and possibly naive) idea was to use sheer and wavy fabric that serves as a beautiful distractor for people at risk of suicide, but should the distraction fail and one choose to jump, strong tarp-like fabric that catches people would be way more effective - a struggle between functionality and aesthetic. What type of fabric would you rather see?"
"Absolutely no idea haha but I like the idea of something functional but also an aesthetic distractor, which accomplishes another function in its own way"
I hate the Vessel and will take any chance to say so. Thanks for the opportunity. Also ANYTHING you do will make the kebab better.
"For your project, I'd be careful to label it a, ""redesign"" and make it something like, ""If you had to build it again""."
Some of these are just completely infeasible due to the cost and the fact that you'd have rip down (at least) half of it in order to achieve it.
"Also, it sounds like you're a landscape architecture student, so probably keep it more to that than reinventing the wheel of the structural part of it. Purely thinking of your grade like your professor probably would."
redesign is fine.
I really like the thinking and planning behind these design. Note that a big constraint for the vessel is that it has to be able to endure (very) high winds/gusts.
"Oh good for you! I love this. FWIW I am not an overwhelming hater of the Vessel but I generally dislike it. It strikes me as very Disneyland or Vegas-y or something, which are not looks that I like for our gritty, elegant city. I like the first one where you have plantings in and around it. Factually speaking, a person could definitely still die from jumping into a softened, multilevel, forest-like canopy of plants -- but you also might not. (Even people who jump onto pavement from four stories or lower sometimes survive.) You might just injure yourself seriously (and possibly go on to live with paralysis) which is an outcome that suicidal people are definitely not seeking. Looking down onto treetops might well introduce that possibility to your mind. I think this supports your hypothesis that some people might at least be dissuaded for the moment and might possibly not make another attempt."
As someone who is a young adult that deals at suicidality I just want to let you know I really appreciate you as a human for looking out for other people
"I really like the first one, but I don't think it's going to help as much. I feel like the ""confusion"" of 2 may help a lot. For some reason I think 4 would be interesting to see."
Thank you for the vote and I like the word confusion. I'm putting together the accompanying text and this would be a fun one to include.
i like the last one. really hard to kys and looks nice.
"Thank you for the vote, and I learned a new acronym!"
haha np
"I love your idea and #1 is really cool, though looking down the inside of the Vessel is already cool.  I really do hope they don't just enclose the whole thing or have ugly plastic walls replace the railings."
"Thank you for the vote! And that's a good point - while I think of ways to make the inside cooler, it's important not to undermine the original design."
I love you both
I like 1 and 4. For this I think a simpler approach is better.
"2 makes for an interesting and lively section, but I think the structural modifications in 3 dimensions make this scheme much more complicated than it looks here, not to mention as others have the issue of size and weight of planting trees on it. 3 goes even further beyond a modification/intervention as it's essentially demolishing the current structure and rebuilding another in its place that bottom line I don't think is different enough to be worthwhile."
"1- I really love the inward focus here. It completely turns the concept around, a refuge that encourages visitors to turn their backs on its surroundings and all that Hudson Yards stands for. There might even be a way to enhance this scheme by adding inward facing reflective materials to the outer boundaries so that even when looking out, you can't help but look in. Bird's nest is also a cute and snappy name that evokes safety and nurturing, a nice cherry on top of the idea itself."
"4- I don't like this one as much aesthetically, but do really appreciate the concept and think at the end of the day is probably the most effective prevention strategy. I also like how it defines new space on the ground level around it that again can be made to feel a little more removed from the surroundings. Not important but still fun is the potential for shadow play on the plaza surface."
"Great project and ideas, very thoughtful!"
Thank you! My mother-in-law told me about Christo and Jean Claude yesterday after seeing the 4th design. When I showed her your comment and it made her so happy!
"I appreciate what you’ve done, but we all must understand that the Vessel was a vanity project, designed and executed without any regard for the needs of ordinary people, for the exclusive amusement of the wealthy. The fact that people are choosing to end their lives using this structure is nothing but an indictment of the economic systems that financed its existence."
TL;DR: the very rich DGAF about anyone else and get richer off our backs.
"I'm frustrated by the privatization of public space too. The more research I do on this topic, the more I question whom Hudson Yards, or other developments alike, is for."
"designed and executed without any regard for the needs of ordinary people, for the exclusive amusement of the wealthy"
Lol it’s a highly popular tourist attraction drawing a wide crowd dude
And a free one at that.
"the vessel itself may be ""free"" (still requires reservation tickets to enter) but why put it there? oh yeah, because there's a huge shopping mall with stores and restaurants. it encourages tourists to come to the area, and then when they're hungry or want to do something else, they'll be surrounded by super expensive things."
it's also an eyesore and a waste of space.
"Waste of space is my biggest gripe with it, beyond it being ugly. New York used to build things people actually needed like public housing and beautiful parks. On what remaining empty space the city has its tragic that the direction the city has turned to is luxury housing and pointless projects like Hudson Yards. I believe that in the future we’ll look back at this like we do urban renewal. The city has an opportunity, in the midst of a housing crisis, to build actual affordable housing and we are choosing not to"
Ya always an opportunity for more affordable housing but there’s not gonna ever be a lot in midtown lol
"Reservation is for crowd control this is New York. Yes it encourages shopping but there’s no such thing as a totally free lunch. A low or normal income family or frugal individual can easily pack a lunch and take a free trip to the area and enjoy the attraction, just like they do at the high line, or at Chelsea piers water front. I disagree with it being wasted space. Cities like San Francisco have beautiful urban hikes and parks with panoramic views of the city all around. Manhattan really lacks that and has become nothing but offices and housing. Putting more housing (preferably affordable housing) alone won’t solve that. Also I don’t really ever see many affordable housing projects go up in Manhattan where the cost of living is so high. Why house low income people where a sandwich costs $13. To force them to go above 96th street or to none trendy parts of other boroughs to enjoy a meal?"
I’m not a dude and you are not thinking critically about Hudson Yards.
You’re calling a free attraction that homeless people can visit and enjoy an “exclusive amusement of the wealthy” - but it’s they who aren’t thinking critically?
"I like 1 and 2, bringing more green to the space."
Thank you for the vote!
I think design 2 definitely is the most practical solution but damn if it wouldn’t be cool to tilt the whole thing like the Guggenheim. That place is a trip
"I don't understand much of design, specially architectural. But your designs seem more than just random doodling, and I appreciate that. 1 & 2 looks pretty nice."
You seem like a loving and compassionate person and I like all of your ideas
Rename it the Suicide vessel
"Contrary to everybody else here I like the vessel. It’s and expensive vanity project but it’s also impressively engineered, boldly designed and wonderful to explore. It’s like an interactive sculpture with a unique aesthetic and constantly evolving perspectives as you make your way to the top through one of countless possible paths. I don’t understand why people hate it. It’s public space, hardly visible from anywhere but Hudson Yards and cost nothing to the public. It’s a present to the city and as a resident I appreciate it."
Now to the redesigns. I think you have some interesting ideas but I’m opposed to any redesign. It can’t be the job of art and architecture to make suicide impossible. I don’t want to live in a rubber box or have my views obstructed by glass or mesh or anything else. The idea with trees is nice but it’s sending the wrong message.
""
"i think you could create a really nice landscape that creates a better approach to the structure and expand the park-like area that would act to enhance the plaza space--perhaps not in Heatherwick Studio's image, but in other ways."
"another idea i had was to block off the top floor, which could be the most attractive jumping spot.  you could do something there...not sure what, but perhaps this level is reserved as a visual gallery floor viewed only from afar."
""
I love 1 & 4 and this idea so much!
"Thank you, and thank you for the vote!"
have you walked to the top of the vessel yourself?
The only acceptable redesign is demolition. For it and the entire glass tumor around it.
I like 1 and 2 best. Great ideas!
Love that you took this project on =)
I love the bird nest idea as it gives the Vessel an actual purpose (i went and it's pretty boring esp since Hudson Yards doesn't have the most amazing views lol). It's like an oasis from construction and city life like Central Park. I'm imagining something like the Singapore Airport!
"My suggestion: have swaths of netting on the outside arranged in a very organic manner like the 4th option but covered with vines/other plants (could be fake flowers and vines even) so that it's not an eyesore but will also help catch any jumpers! During christmas, can be cover with some lights too =)) so that it feels like the netting has an aesthetic purpose rather than the true morbid purpose!"
Great work!
WooWwW I drew inspiration from the Singapore Airport!! So thrilled that message came through and led your imagination back to the airport - such an important validation for me! And thank you for the suggestion!
"I like your ideas 1 and 2. The 4th concept might be effective for this purpose, but looks utilitarian). My association with 3 is, I climb to the top and ""there is nowhere else to go""; also, there are no choices which path to take to the top; or one might ""give up"" half way  (in either sense) as ""the rest is the same as it was before"""
Wow neat!
"I think 1 and 2 are great. Could they be combined? Also, I really hope they do something about the Vessel."
1 or 2. The netting idea is too obviously an attempted solution to suicide. Kind of negates the purpose of distracting people from negative thoughts. Greenery and more natural elements could produce a calming effect. What about adding benches or art work as well? Or a way to amplify the noises of the trees/birds/bugs/etc?
I like it. The whole city needs more trees in general. HY feels monotonous and tasteless and some landscaping is needed to break up all the concrete look. It's ugly.
I like the concepts you're working with.
The one time I really scared myself with suicidal thoughts and neared action I had not been thinking anything like suicide.
"I was hiking across a bridge, it was a major holiday I'd spent alone but I wasn't really dwelling on that, just tired from hiking and I guess a bit emotionally numb when I saw a suicide prevention hotline sign and another and another on the bridge and the thought came ""why not? This is a good spot."""
"The only reason I didn't get closer to it is that there was one lone person also on rhe bridge and I was afraid he would see. I made it across the bridge and ever since I've wondered how often those signs save, and how often they trigger it"
"this probably won't work very well, but what if there was something like a waterfall that goes down along the railing of the vessel, i think that would take a lot of my attention :P"
"I mean, an aviary style dome ceiling would be effective, and allow for the vessel to be comfortably accessed when it's raining or snowing."
edit: read too fast to see that you acknowledged an enclosure would work
I’m really impressed with you and your 4 interesting and thoughtful ideas on how to address and deter others from attempting suicide at the vessel.  I do like the concepts with the calmness of the greenery. And I like the Guggenheim inspired concept. They’re truly all great.
