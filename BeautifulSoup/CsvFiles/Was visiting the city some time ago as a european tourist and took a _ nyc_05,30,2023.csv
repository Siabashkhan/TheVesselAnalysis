Are we talking about deadpool or the midle fingers?
All of it
"Receiving the middle finger is quite an honor, it's the official ""Welcome to NYC""."
It feels so retro these days.
Still do it‚Ä¶but in PA‚Ä¶.don‚Äôt think they like it too much :)
First weekend of October
Only in the movies. In real life it‚Äôs rude af
"Nah, where's your sense of humor?"
My first thought was seeing people on the vessel
"I work down near there and kept meaning to go.  Then it shut down after people kept jumping off it, and now I don‚Äôt think you can go up it anymore."
"So sad after watching them build the think from sections floated and to the west side, then craned and driven to the site."
"Whatever you think of the structure, it was fascinating watching it being built day after day."
"I went once.  It was‚Ä¶fine.  Seemed like a waste of space, and I don‚Äôt know why no one thought to make it hard for people to jump from it."
The vessel being part of hudson yards phase one and being permanently closed while NYC is in the middle of a housing crisis is both depressing and hilarious. I‚Äôm sure the Germans have a word for it
the guy jumping off the kebab
Yes
Seems like you visited during when NY Comic Con was going on so this visit came in month of October.
Yes it was october 2019. Never really knew who to share this picture with until now

"Maybe you were here during Comic Con. Typically held in the Javitz center, its on the west half of Manhattan. Like the vessel."
Very well possible. The deadpool was definetly not the only superhero i saw that day
"I mean, the Deadpool and the girl are not even the only Cosplayers in your picture."
It's basically across the street from op
"Yeah! There's even a puffy Iron Man, running late across the street. He's gonna run into that robot street performer!"
Thought it was going to be someone ending thier game at the vessel. Pleasantly surprised it's just comiconners
Two possible answers:
"I don't see anything weird or out of place in the photo. Yes, there are costumed adventurers all over the place in New York."
Clearly Doctor Strange was messing with the multiverse and you were briefly in a variant of New York with Deadpool.

Looks like a normal picture of HY.
Deadpool doing the ‚ÄúDeadpool pose‚Äù is great lol
Lot going on here lol
Yet here I was looking for a jumper...
Congratulations. You managed to capture the only spontaneous fun ever to have happened in Hudson Yards.
"If you were these in October, that's definitely New York ComicCon. She might be giving you the finger because she thinks you're taking her picture without consent."
Main character syndrome is a real thing!
I feel for her. She's walking around in a playboy outfit so a lot of dudes were probably taking creep shots. Hopefully she finds this post and realizes the only curves OP was interested in were the hexagonal sexiness of the Vessel.
And nobody is commenting on the fact that the person appears to be 9 feet tall.
Tbh if she wasnt giving me this awesome reaction i wouldve preferred her out of the frame
Must have been during Comic Con. It's held at the Javits Center across the street.
Deadpool and spiderman cosplayers do some of the most hilarious things
"Yes, but Deadpool cosplayers are also often some of the most unfunny people on the planet."
The chick in the bunny costume looks 7ft tall.
Nice üòä
Welcome to NY! üòä
Looks like Comic Con weekend. Hudson Yards is right across the street from Javits.
Welcome to NYC!
A new sushi and ramen place opened up nearby appropriately called SURAM and goddam they're going to make a killing during comicon
NYCC always a good time.
You were visiting during comic con which is held basically right next door to this picture
Did someone lamborghini rear light louvers and make a scultpture with em
There's a couple of people staring in your direction...leads me to believe something was said to catch people's attention
"No i was really just being a regular citizen, walking around, taking touristy pics of my surrounding like dozens of other people around me. As a previous person said they thought i was taking pictures of her without her consent but I was standing at least 20 m away (sorry dont know what that is in freedom units, nowhere close thats for sure) taking pictures with my phone. Let me be clear that i had no big camera setup or macro lens. So thats why all these people were mad and shouting at me. I dont understand how someone can think theyre that important or interesting."
Gotta watch out for that pesky deadpool
"The dude that's bout to step up on the edge of the pool is giving eternal, invulnerable, Logan/Wade/Hailey* type vibes.  *Heroes"
Such a normal day in NYC
I thought there was gonna be a jumper in the background
Deadpool has to be the most annoying character. I can‚Äôt image how much worse those time square performers probably are
Did you walk into a furry convention?
Half of Americans have mental health issues
How many people jumped off that thing already? And did we even mention all the snack sellers on the road below these luxury buildings?
"and if you communicate as poorly as you do, you‚Äôre considered a moron."
"Lmao you're the one who came into this thread already butthurt, commenting about something completely unrelated to the pic."
No laws are forced here. Its do whatever you want. Lawless land. If you force anything your considered racist
lol
Im moving in here in june üòà
Makes the picture even better.
Welcome to NYC üóΩ
Why do tourists like the vessel?
"Middle of the picture, third from the left. Zoom in on the face. White wig."
Explain to me what exactly I'm looking at.
Welcome to new yawk ü§£
"Yup, looks about NY üòÇ"
