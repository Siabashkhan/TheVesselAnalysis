Lobby of the Galactic Senate.
Or similar!
I was thinking the TVA from the Loki series.
That's actually a real building. Gimme a second to find it
Here's an article on it. It's a Marriott. 
Is this the place they had to redesign or put up gates because people kept jumping off?
"Yes, was there two weeks ago, can confirm. You can only enter on the base level now and look up. I have pics from day and night tho"
"Edit: the vessel, not the Marriott"
That is my only complaint... that it is not retro. But it is futuristic.
An astounding public work that had unforseen consequences. Four people have thrown themselves to their deaths from the sculpture & it still remains closed to the public now apart from the ground floor.
"Unforseen consequences? The first time I went to the vessel, the first thing I thought was: ""someone's gonna jump from here."""
And the architect refused to add safety barriers even after several deaths.
"I mean ultimately people are going to do what they‚Äôre going to do. I live by a bridge and when I wake up and see search copters I know that someone jumped. People still do it, but they have phones there for crisis lines."
Edit: I guess you could argue ‚Äúthe call of the void‚Äù made them do it
"True, but it‚Äôs been scientifically proven adding safety barriers cuts down on suicides by a large margin. I myself thought they would be ultimately useless but the stats don‚Äôt lie."
Interesting. Does it just make it easier to go somewhere else to commit suicide so they don‚Äôt do it in the middle of Hudson yards?
"I think the thing is deep down, humans just don‚Äôt want to die. Safety barriers add that little thing that makes you rethink. Like those people who say popping individual pills made them stop, but wouldn‚Äôt if they all would‚Äôve come in a single bottle. Or people who almost hanged themselves who said they wouldn‚Äôt have rethought it if they had a gun."
"I 100% agree. ~90% of suicide attempts are probably a cry for help, and I‚Äôve known many people through drug recovery communities years ago."
"I‚Äôm probably going beyond the scope of this discussion here, but you have me piqued."
"Someone jumping to a hard surface surely must expect death, most like the people jumping off my bridge. Are they the 10% that are dedicated to death, or if all of these places were safer would people just not commit suicide as much?  I do know the ‚Äúcall of the void‚Äù can be a real phenomena from actual experience as well. I‚Äôd imagine when severely depressed / suicidal, and you come up on that ledge, and feel that call, perhaps it‚Äôs more tempting than the deceased originally intended."
"I read that people tend to have a preferred method, or even location. They don‚Äôt just pick another when it‚Äôs made unavailable."
I gotta change my number
I help build it and sadly that‚Äôs all I could think about
why dont they let us have nice things?
cause the city spent a ton of money on it instead of helping with the rampant housing crisis which is part of the reason people keep jumping off of it.  We can have cool vanity art installations when people aren't literally dying in the street cause thousands of empty apartments are going for 5 figures a month.
we're statistically past the point of the level of wealth inequality in this country than what caused the French to cut the fucking heads off and abolish their nobility.
""
or the people?
we're getting to the point pretty quickly where they can take the human out of their army and then we're all enslaved.
true.
"The city issued special district permits, so there‚Äôs some money foregone, but construction appears to be private money. People jumped off because they were miserable."
"Certainly tragic that 4 people died by their own choices, but I will never understand how that justifies prohibiting the rest of us from enjoying something like this. It's bad enough that the selfishness of those 4 has negatively affected their friends/families. It's ridiculous to extend that to negatively affecting everyone else."
"The problem with allowing suicide spots to remain accessible, is that they become known for being suicide spots, which then draws in more people to use that place as a suicide spot."
"Places like the Nanjin Yangtze River Bridge, The Golden Gate bridge, Aokigahara forest, and the Prince Edward Viaduct are notorious for their suicides, and as such, are actually sometimes planned destinations for people planning on ending it. As a New Yorker, I'm okay with this being shutdown indefinitely, especially if it's inaccessibility saves even one life."
That's my professional response to your comment.
My emotional response is:
""
"Maybe netting could be put up, could that possibly work?"
They have refused to install anti-suicide barriers at every step of the project.
"Yep, there have been plenty of fine suggestions for safety but the artist refuses."
"The problem with allowing suicide spots to remain accessible, is that they become known for being suicide spots, which then draws in more people to use that place as a suicide spot."
"The other half of this is that risk of suicide correlates strongly with having a convenient method.  In England, suicide by asphyxiation was common when public utilities supplied homes with coal gas (high in carbon monoxide).  When utilities switched to natural gas (basically no carbon monoxide) not only did such suicides basically stop but people didn't simply switch to other methods.  The overall suicide rate dropped by 30%."

This is a publicly accessible area which generates interest and enjoyment for people. It also expended a lot of resources to create it and it would be wasteful to not therefore use it to its fullest extent.
"While mitigation should be carried out to discourage or make it more difficult for people to jump off this structure and ones like them, and other areas that people suffer suicides at, it would be disproportionate to permanently close areas that have other benefits to people simply because of tragedies that occur there."
"It's a design failure, and they refuse any alterations to make it safer. It's a white elephant."
Yes the owner/designer refusing mitigations that they don't like is nonsense and they should just be made to do it.
Do you want it to be enjoyed by the public or not? The creators/designers‚Äô desires are irrelevant if so.
"Private resources were expended. The city didn't pay for this. This was a bunch of millionaires and billionaires privately funding Hudson yards to be what it is. Not only did the artist refuse to take safety measures, the owner of the vessel is refusing to retroactively install safety measures because they insist it's an eyesore."

"exactly, thats how i feal about these things."
what a disgusting comment
It‚Äôs not that simple I am afraid.
I think the part that people leave out is that there‚Äôs other people there. This isn‚Äôt jumping off a bridge into the water. This is jumping off a platform onto other platforms with other people. The horror caused to others is unnecessary and the injury that could be caused to others is dangerous and irresponsible.
"Describing suicide as ""selfish"" betrays a lack of imagination and empathy. Perhaps if these posters above ever have a mental-health crisis, they'll have a more mature perspective."
"If you want to learn about the failures of design which made these suicides more likely, this is an interesting video on the topic:"
https://youtu.be/Bw3256SkN0k
Speaking of lack of imagination
Because today everyone thinks they are responsible for everything. Majorly annoying.
‚ÄúAstounding‚Äù? It‚Äôs stairs in the shape of a pine cone.  It‚Äôs ‚Äúinstagram-able‚Äù in the same manner as neon angel wings or a three pound ice cream cone can be.  Its not even that tall. There are better views of the Hudson in the surrounding buildings.   Rip it down and put in some trees.
I used the term 'astounding' in summation for not just for it's physical form but for the myriad of ways this folly has manifested itself in time - i'm using it in the same manner that one could call witnessing a traffic accident as 'exciting'.
"Those people were very ill people, who were also having the worst day of their lives."
Catholic mentality
Is it poor taste to be pissed at them for preventing anyone else from getting this view?
Wow
Better than them jumping in front of a subway car. That's really inconvenient.
"Ask a mortician did a wonderful video about the vessel, the deaths on it, and how other buildings have addressed the same issue."
https://youtu.be/Bw3256SkN0k
I love this video. Very informational and very moving. Ask a Mortician always does a great job.
The Wastebasket
Hideous Suicide Hive.
They won‚Äôt let you go to the top anymore because people were jumping. I was there a few weeks ago!
Fuck everything about Hudson Yards and their wanna be imperial city
I had to walk through it to get to Javits. Felt like Westworld ü§ñ
"I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that Thomas Heatherwick is a bit of a charlatan. Or at best, an artist playing at being an architect."
A bit like Calatrava
I thought the LIC library would be the most expensive non-usable space in the city then came the Vessel
"Reminds me of the early cover art for the novel ""House of Stairs"" by William Sleator."
"A few days late but I've seldom met anyone else who read that book!  I still have a copy and re-read it every few years, Such a great dystopian story."
The vertical black rail-looking thing‚Ä¶ I half expect at some point to find a giant pinball-machine ball rolling down it and sink into that hole at the bottom. Ding!
"I haven't been yet, but hope to go (and go up!) someday. I wish it were able to be open to the public."
""
It's an art piece that used to be walkable on. Designed by a Londoner in Hudson Yards in nyc but it's shut now because of four suicides off the top.
I don't know if I'd call someone in so much pain they threw themselves off a building a jerk.
Suicide is a monetary urge. Most people who attempt to commit suicide don't die from suicide.
"I consider someone who commits suicide in a public place, traumatizing everyone around, a jerk. They clearly didn't care about the damaging effects of their actions on the people around them."
The worst example of this is the people who commit suicide by jumping in front of cars or trains. In the case of the car they could literally kill someone but even if they don't they are inflciting real psychological harm to the driver. Id imagine jumping off a building in a public place has a similar effect on those who witness it.
You show a knee-jerk failure of imagination and empathy.
"Consider the mental state of someone contemplating suicide. The hopelessness, misery, loneliness - the claustrophobia of intrusive thoughts, fear, self-disgust, emptiness. The call of the abyss."
"If you don't know what a mental-health crisis actually feels like from the inside, I think it takes a pretty small person to judge those who have been gripped by that stalking, insidious horror, and succumbed."
""
I feel you are so right but unfortunately in this particular forum the users do not have the awareness/depth/maturity to understand.
"I don't particularly understand how we can label someone suffering suicide as not selfish. It is both tragic and selfish surely. It's someone deciding that they will do something for themselves regardless of others, which inherently is a selfish act, but that level of despair and desperation is the unfortunate consequence of where their illness has reached."
"There are plenty of situations where a person has experienced hardship, trauma, great misfortune etc. But that never excuses causing harm to others, which is what this does."
"I can certainly empathize with the person facing suicidal thoughts, ive been in that situation myself, but they still had a choice, nobody forced them to do this in full view of the public, they chose to inflict harm on others, that makes them... a jerk."
"Edit: suicide its self is not selfish, the act of suicide its self does not make someone a jerk, the jerk move is involving random strangers forcing them to witness it. The majority of suicide victims don't inflict trauma on others like that and I certainly would not consider them jerks."
"Neither you or I have walked in the shoes of that person who stepped off the ledge. I think you're being reductive and judgemental. Seems pretty easy to go ""pfft, jerk"", rather than exercising your imagination and empathy."
""
"Yes, im judging the actions of someone, thats a thing we do. You are being judgemental of me right now."
"Im not lacking empathy or ""imagination"". I assure you I fully understand what it feels like to want to end my life. Ive been there. But again, that feeling of hopelessness does no excuse actions I, or anyone else, takes in that moment. I can understand that someone may have been going through something terrible and still condemn the actions they took."
"An extreme example: A school kid has is being abused at home, his life in a living hell, full of hurt and anger. At school this manifests by him assaulting a fellow classmate in the bathroom. The kid here is a tragic figure, yes, and I can empathise with someone who is enduring ongoing trauma, but that doesn't mean his actions are excused. He still did something horrible to the other student."
"I maintain that, regardless of what they are going through, someone who choses to take their own life in a way that endangers the lives of others or inflicts real harm on others, is being a jerk. You can feel free to disagree with me, but spare me the ""you're a small person"" attacks."
"I dunno, just seems kind of jerky to me."
This is a weird argument.  Like who are they defending here?  The person you‚Äôre calling a jerk is dead - I think they are beyond caring whether you are judging them or not.
"Ever climbed 5 flights of stairs looked out a window?  You‚Äôve experienced it.  Is that art? So subjective, gotta think about it?"
Id think its more the symmetry and the fact it looks like some sort of surreal setting from fiction. It certainly looks extraordinary
No.
""
Name is in the title.
The name of the building is literally in the title. What more of a hint do you need?
Butt-ugly bollocks.
im a fan of geometry (in a visual aspect); i find this architecture vastly satisfying!
Yeah I don‚Äôt get why people can‚Äôt admit that this thing is cool
Ever had a dream of being somewhere like this?
A lot of Season 4 of Westworld took place in front of this structure.
Did they ever put up the nets they were talking about?
As if NYC doesn't have enough concrete and stairs.
An enormous waste of money.

The pine cone.
It‚Äôs pretty creepy looking.
