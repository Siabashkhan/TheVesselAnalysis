The new favorite spot for suicidal people to jump off sadly..
Oh shit..for real? I guess they will have to net it like Foxcon buildings.
Yea unfortunately.
It’s one of the few spots that’s just totally open and high enough that’s open to the public.
I think this would have been so much cooler had it not been done in rose gold. Copper would have been so much better in my opinion.
