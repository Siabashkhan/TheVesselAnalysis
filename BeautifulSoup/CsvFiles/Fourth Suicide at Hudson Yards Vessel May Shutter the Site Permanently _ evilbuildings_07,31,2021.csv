"Just raise the height of the railings. A small deterrent goes a long way, and I‚Äôve seen that work on many bridges."
They did. They tripled security. Trained them in suicide prevention. Have signs offering mental health help.
"It was a teenaged boy with a history of suicide attempts there with his family. It‚Äôs horrific but if it wasn‚Äôt jumping off of this, it might‚Äôve just been jumping in front of a train or something."
"Incorrect. Lots of suicides are opportunistic. There‚Äôs study after study that once people are deterred, only a small minority attempt it again."
"To echo this, many survivors who attempted suicide at the golden gate bridge regretted their choice halfway down and realized their problems were treatable after that."

He clearly said he had a history of attempts so that idea goes right out the window with this particular case.
"Ok maybe in this case it would have been hard to prevent this kid from taking his own life. But for the other jumpers, it may have worked to have nets. Who knows, maybe the feeling would have passed."
"Pains me to see these senseless deaths, since I‚Äôve felt hopeless at times, but the dark cloud passes. They just had to give themselves more time to figure things out."
Source?
1978 study on Golden Gate Bridge survivors 
The 1978 Seiden study at the Golden Gate Bridge showed that 90 percent of those stopped from jumping did not later die by suicide or other violent means.
A Harvard School of Public Health article reviewing numerous studies showed more broadly that ‚ÄúNine out of ten people who attempt suicide and survive will not go on to die by suicide at a later date.‚Äù
Harvard study 
"OK so thanks for the source, here's my problem with it. One, where do we define ""prevented"" from actually stopped? For example, one could get to the edge and compilate suicide, but decide against. If they where prevented, it might have still ended in the same result. Two, this individual in the comment you replied to had ""multiple attempts"" meaning that he would have been in that 10%. Three, the comment did say that the building had multiple protective measures like that of the golden gate Bridge. Four, I think the golden gate Bridge might have other factors at play that make it more likely that the people who tried suicide might not be a representation of the community."
"If you are open to further challenging your perspective and learning more about suicide attempts and survivals at the Golden Gate, I would definitely recommend checking out the documentary Jumpers. I think it may be on YouTube."
"Thank you. I will check it out! I'm always willing to reexamine my opinion as long as I'm provided alternate views that are rooted in honest dialog (like this has been!). Really thank you, it's rare not to get swamped by people's aggression on Reddit, but rather friendly communication."
I respect when folks are truly willing to consider an alternative perspective (which you seem to be based on your other comments); it's unfortunately too rare these days. This film certainly gave me a new perspective on suicide and dispelled a lot of assumptions I had. Be warned it's a tough watch.
"The vessel didn‚Äôt put up nets like the Golden Gate Bridge, as the company determined that it would spoil the aesthetic. They falsely came to the conclusion that having suicide watchers, banning single tickets, and bit higher railing would be enough. The corporate machine adds yet another death to their tally."
"You are right about the boy being in the 10%. But everyone deserves a chance to be saved, however small the chance."
"Fair. I also am of the opinion that protecting minor freedoms (such as not mandating suicide nets), is more important than protecting people from self harm. I know this is a minority opinion, but it's mine. Thank you for taking the time to source and explain your position. I don't necessarily agree 100%, but I understand your stance."
Using a study from 40+ years to deal with suicide in the modern era? It‚Äôs like using a study from the Middle Ages and saying most people think the earth is flat.
I‚Äôd be curious to see how the data would be different if the exact same study was repeated in 2021. I can guarantee you the stats will be very different - more people will be disappointed they didn‚Äôt die.
Have basic human emotions changed drastically over 40 years? The triggers might be different but the emotional reactions would be same.
I‚Äôd say they have changed. Dramatically. Just a few examples off the top:
"‚Ä¢ 40 years ago you were only limited to people in your social circle to bully you, and only while they were next to you. At least you had a chance to breathe and focus."
"Now? Thanks to the internet and social media, you can have countless of people bully you from across the world, right from their living room, 24/7/365. You will never hear the end of it."
"‚Ä¢ 40 years ago, if you ever made a big mistake, people eventually forgot about it. This helped give a chance to move on and focus on living life."
"Now? A tweet or message of you from when you were 12 can get you to lose your career, your family, and your life‚Äôs work. Moving new places won‚Äôt help. It will follow you until you die. You will never be allowed to live life normally. You will always be known for your mistake."
"‚Ä¢ 40 years ago, the family circle, while not perfect, was still there. By that I mean a group of people who know you and look out for you, like you do them. Friends, family, neighbors, the local grocery dude‚Ä¶etc. Even in your darkest moments, someone out there would lend a hand."
Now? Most people are born and raised in broken homes. Most people don‚Äôt even know who their neighbors are. You could actually go a whole day without anyone even talking to to you or showing any sign of human interaction.
"I personally can vouch for this: in one of my very dark suicidal times, spent almost 1 month where no one talked to me (unless you count the person at the cash register)."
"I have no friends, my family hasn‚Äôt talked to me in years, and making friends has been difficult because of my depression. And this goes to my next point"
"‚Ä¢ as much as we as a society have made it less‚Ä¶weird to admit mental health issues, those people will face serious consequences as a result of even speaking up - did you know that even one visit to a therapist can make you lose your job in certain fields? That wasn‚Äôt so 40 years ago."
"Sure, we have to stop violent mentally ill people, but someone who suffers from depression is now on the same level of warning as a sociopath with a criminal record."
"In the end, all this makes people take one of three choices:"
‚Ä¢ suffer without treatment until you die
‚Ä¢ suffer because you seeked treatment until you die
‚Ä¢ suffer the pain and anguish of suicide until you die
It was a teenaged boy with a history of suicide attempts there with his family.
"Well, that doesn't seem like the type of place to take your suicidal son to."
Or install nets. How about making mental healthcare more accessible? People aren't killing themselves because it's tall.

a hanging garden?? üò¨

Lol there's a song by the Goth band The Cure called The Hanging Garden so you're not alone in that regard
"Edit: Yes I am aware The Cure is a ""Goth influence"" and is a post punk band. I used Goth as a blanket term so people unfamiliar with them could understand my comment since Goth is identifiable as dark themes."
Amazing song! AFI covered it and it's a great cover also.
The Cure are not a goth band.
Yes and no. The correct term is most likely Post Punk. They heavily influenced what would later become Goth music. I used Goth as a blanket term so people could understand my point a bit more.
The only reason they are not goth is because they are one of the bands that made goth a thing. They were goth before goth was a thing just like Shaggy from Scooby Doo is totally grunge before that was a style in the late 80s/early 90s.
"Like I said, it was mainly just used as a blanket term. I know they are post punk but not everyone would be able to identify them or the genre of post punk as a Goth influence, so I opted to use a blanket term so it was easier to understand."
I was agreeing with you. :)
Oh god now I realise what you mean. I'm so sorry my mind was at the suicides and forgot the concepy of a garden

"It's becoming an iconic suicide spot sadly for some reason so I think they're better off not tempting fate. Going up there is fine, but it's not exactly an amazing view because the buildings surrounding it block off most of what you could see."
Going up there is fine

"The stopping at the end is fine, it's the organs ceasing to work harmoniously that is the problem."

So you think that spending maybe a couple of hundred thousand on anti-suicide measures is a waste of money but letting a $200M tourist attraction close permanently is a good idea?
There was a major public study done here in CA on suicide fences on Cal Trans bridges it was such a problem.
"Turns out its a wash, netting, fencing and other measures simply displaces those deaths to other locations or means."
"Their conclusions were to skip it all together and let people go for it, but that was politically impossible to do after victim's families rallied and turned their grief into public policy. So now we have 8 ft chainlink blocking all views from greater than 12 ft drops. Really going for that dystopian look."
Good points. The golden gate has managed it pretty well doing patrols. I remember reading numbers were way way down but you are right. Different settings probably attract different depressed \ troubled demographics.
Closing it won‚Äôt make any money that‚Äôs a net loss?
"Cornell in Ithaca uses suicide nets, and (I believe) the suicides went down."
"Was that a state or even city-area number reduction, or could that be attributed to..."
"Turns out its a wash, netting, fencing and other measures simply displaces those deaths to other locations or means."

You are grossly misrepresenting that data. Suicide nets at Calif. bridges prevent suicides. The only people who don't want them are nimbys who think some kind of unaltered view is more valuable than human life.
Suicide is an impulsive act so stopping people during an attempt works.
https://slate.com/technology/2013/10/golden-gate-bridge-suicide-barrier-controversy-and-cost-over-a-life-saver.html
"""The evidence showing that bridge barriers work is ‚Äúoverwhelming,‚Äù says Paula Clayton, professor of psychiatry at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine and former medical director of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. Most people die the first time they try to kill themselves. The easiest way to prevent suicide is by restricting access to methods with a high risk of death, Clayton says‚Äîsuch as jumping from a bridge."
"A 2013 meta-analysis led by Australian suicide expert Jane Pirkis reviewed studies of deterrents at suicide hot spots around the world. The interventions reduced suicides by jumping at the sites by about 85 percent. Although there was an uptick in jumping at neighboring sites in some cities in the decades after deterrents were erected, the dramatic drop in jumping at the hot spots led to reduced overall rates of suicide by jumping."""
drop in jumping at the hot spots led to reduced overall rates of suicide by jumping.
""
"""unaltered view is more valuable than human life."" I think a safe and secure world rigged up with nets, razor\barbed wire, cattle fencing, and miles of ""deterrents"" gives me l'appel du vide personally. It is not sound public policy to deter suicide, that should be a humanist policy or at very least a religious\spiritual one for the cynical out there."
Get the human help they need to them and leave the galvanized steel out of the equation.
"The quickest, easiest way to prevent suicides at bridges is to put up netting. If you're against that you're pro-suicide."
So what you're saying is... We need to build suicide cabins everywhere so people can suicide safely? Maybe one with a meatgrinder function that disposes it into the sewers so they cabin is fresh for the next customer..?
I think Belgium is looking into it.
Futurama is really predicting everything.
"Oh well fuck it then, let‚Äôs continue to let people easily commit suicide at a popular tourist attraction full of families and children rather than displacing them elsewhere."
Good thing there aren't any other tall buildings that are popular tourist attractions in new york
"Nooo! Don't let them suicide, we need them to stay depressed but productive... Obligatory /s"
So maybe Suicide booths? So that way families and children don't have to see that.
Golden gate managed it pretty well having walkers patrol the bridge. Its deaths and attempts are way way down. Probably the way to go honestly.

"OP is simply pointing out that this is a reactive ""solution"" that negatively impacts the people who would normally enjoy the structure, when in an ideal world we would be focusing on proactive social support programs that make the issue effectively moot in the first place.  Maybe that's a pipe dream in the world as it is today, but it is still a very valid point."
Why not spend $200M on anti-suicide measures?
$200M won't stop all suicides. You'll still need prevention measures at the vessel.
Sure.
"No. It just feels like putting a bandaid on a bullet hole. On the large scale, I'd rather society spends money on becoming better than 100s to 1000s of antisuicide measures at attractions like this"
"One is an instant fix, the other is a decades long investment."
do both
Definitely but in the context of this attraction we shouldn't close it down while we wait for a years long investment to pay off.
The architect probably won‚Äôt give a shit since the structure is already built and it‚Äôs ultimately up to the owner anyway.
That‚Äôs an art project as much as a business dealing. Do you think an author would mind if their publisher rewrote the plot of their book after signing a contract? I do. The architect probably cares very much how it‚Äôs presented and what changes are made. Particularly since it‚Äôs a famous structure which they can include in their portfolio.

It's only like that if you think the people jumping off Hudson Yards Vessel are chasing mink.
"If you build it they will come. In this case, it's a high, uncovered fancy staircase that easily allows suicidal people to jump. Not taking that in to account as an architect is simply irresponsible."
"They would just go elsewhere, won't they? I don't see how the architect is to blame here, instead of spending money/energy on suicide proof buildings, those funds should go towards mental support etc."
"A lot of people seem to be saying this, but on reality it's not so simple. We have a bridge nearby that's a very easy suicide spot. Lots of people are picked up there or jump. The laybys next to it are permanently shut, but it's still very easy to get to."
"People who are intent on suicide often do so without warning. They don't always ask for help because they don't want help, they just don't want to continue the life they have. Making it harder to take their life gives another opportunity for that help, whether its directly asked for, or the warning signs picked up. They might well just go elsewhere to do so but any time for intervention is positive."
"Mental health care is chronically short of funding. Maybe a practical measure to increase opportunity for intervention is more beneficial than putting that money into a system starved of staff at all levels, crisis management, actual useful resources, and most of accessibility. It depends where that funding goes."
"I agree wholeheartedly that more funding is welcome, but it's a drop in the ocean."
"Sure, the idea isn't really to help the people who are ready to commit suicide by providing help they can ask for, it is to prevent people from getting to that final stage in the first place. The former isn't completely futile either but it is kinda late."
"We are just talking without any data, but I think a little bit of funding to mental health stuff is more helpful than relaying a suicider towards another method. Maybe the latter gives another chance at intervention as you say but if there is noone to intervene it is pointless as well. You can commit suicide so many ways it's a losing game trying to prevent it this way imo, it mostly just serves as a way of saving the ""reputation"" of a place."
"But if you have data that shows a decline in suicide in general after a location was made suicide proof, I like to see it."
"No. In Malcolm Gladwell's book, Talking to Strangers, he writes that suicide is often a case of desire and access."
"He talked about how in England, cooking gas used to be a mix of CO and some other gas. The rate of suicide was higher because it was relatively easy for people to commit suicide ‚Äî was easy access (as well as relatively painless). But when they switched to a different gas, the rate of suicides dropped. Importantly, those people DID NOT choose another method. If they had just moved to a different method, the rate of suicide would've stayed the same."
"...Gladwell cites an article published in 1988 by two criminologists about the link between carbon monoxide in domestic gas and suicide in England and Wales. The paper argued persuasively that the phasing out of lethal ‚Äútown gas‚Äù in Britain in the 1960s and ‚Äô70s caused a decline in suicides. When cooking stoves no longer provided an easy way to kill oneself, many who might thus have ended their lives did not pursue alternative methods. Gladwell thinks this historical context ought to affect our view of the poet Sylvia Plath, who was unfortunate enough to have town gas in her London home, and killed herself with it in 1963."

"Interesting, thanks."
I also found a bunch of stuff about the ban of hazardous pesticides leading to a decrease in suicide across Asia.
"I still believe this isn't the proper solution (as even if one cannot commit suicide, their reasons to do so do not go away) but it is good to hear it is somewhat effective."
"My other concern is for the difference between the modes of suicide discussed here, dying by gas might be interpreted as a ""softer"" method than jumping from tall structures onto hard surfaces. Whoever is willing to go for the latter I'd assume will have an easier time finding a replacement, either by different tall buildings or jumping in front of trains etc. I'm just speculating however."
"Meh. I've walked around it, it's neat. Those people would have killed themselves regardless."
Or...evil????

Publishers absolutely rewrite books before publication
"I'm really surprised people don't know this. I actually wrote to a favorite author once, due to the fact that her books in a series I was reading suddenly had explicit sex all the time, that added nothing to the plot. Even her covers changed to the character in underwear. She wrote back that she was told it was necessary. Sucks. It makes me wonder how much better so many books would be if they didn't have to follow what the masses want at the time. Independently published books have less changes as far as I know. I read a lot of self published books."
Heatherwick is all for it but the actual owner - Related Co - refuses
Ah interesting
Why can't we do both things?
"Yeah an architect may not like it but with as much respect I have for artist, people's lives are more important. If I made something and someone else modified it to make it safer, I know I'd understand and I'm going to question anyone who wouldn't."
If only net money was enough to cover that...
Does the architect have a say in it anymore?  It has been open for a while.
"The architect (Heatherwick) actually designed higher barriers for this purpose, but the developer refused to put them in."
""
"That's how suicidality usually works though. Very impulsive, so anything that breaks the path can often stop it from happening at all."
"Yeah but maybe they‚Äôll go somewhere without dozens of families and children. Not all will, but some would."
So we'll just make one less place to bring families?
For real. Even some shurbs could break a fall if they are planted thick enough. It would be big injuries but might not be death.
Brilliant idea.
"They'll just jump from the outward facing rim, dude."
I am literally suggesting putting nets under the 'ideal' jump point i.e. under the outside of the structure.

"The point is, if you take away a highly effective and near instantaneous method of death, people won't use it."

They were advised to put up barriers but the artist and the yards said no.

I‚Äôve heard this several times.
"But as someone who wants to learn to shoot, but doesn‚Äôt really need to buy a gun, how would I go about this?  Booking a lesson or something?"
"Bring a friend with you, or take a class if they offer them. My local gun store / range offers classes and you get to shoot a selection of pistols. You don't need a pistol to go to that class. There are instructors constantly present though unlike if you just rent a lane."
"Pretty much. It's a conundrum. I wanted to learn to shoot. Also wanted to find out what gun I should buy. But they won't let me rent it by myself.  The guy at the range was really nice and gave me some pointers personally because the range was not too busy. But generally it's a no go.  If I was to try all over again, what I would do is to buy a 22lr pistol like Taurus TX22 or Glock 44 or S&W 22lr, or Rugar's similar offerings. This way you are now considered a ""gun owner"" so free to rent whatever on your own. Plus 22lr pistol is useful for training too."
Just look into your local laws. I've never heard of this anywhere I've lived
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a laws thing, just range policy"
Right. Never heard of it. How else are you gonna decide what gun to buy? You may need a permit to rent in some states
It‚Äôs the same at my shooting range. You can also only rent and shoot a gun if you‚Äôre a member. I don‚Äôt think they let guests rent firearms.
"But you could shoot yourself at the range with your own gun, so how does this solve anything?"
"Also, it shows that being alone makes no difference because you're not alone at a gun range."
"That just sounds like suicide with extra steps. They figure you'll just do it at home if you own a gun, not their problem."
""
"Second, if you already have a firearm, you don't need to go to a gun range to kill yourself, which is what they're trying to prevent."
"Finally, gun ranges have 'lanes' separated by anti-ballistic barriers and nobody (at least at the one I go to) stands behind you and watches you. They have cameras but the employees are on the other side of sound and ballistic baffles etc. They aren't in there with you."
"But again, it's not my policy, and it doesn't bother me whether you believe in it or think it's effective."
""
"That's honestly the best, least-intrusive anti-suicide measure I've heard of in this entire thread."
A girl I went to high school with committed suicide at a gun range. She was with a friend.
A policy can still be effective even if there are rate exceptions.
That‚Äôs super messed up though.
The 4th suicide at the vessel was with the kids parents and grandmother
Something I just realized is that a person willing to make a serious suicide attempt (not simply a cry-for-help) likely has no friends or family willing to spend time with them.
Not true at all.
"What is true is that this myth ends up meaning many warning signs are missed, because people think ""they were so happy, had an amazing family, always with friends, we didn't see the signs""."
Missed or ignored.
"This may help you understand, it‚Äôs a quote by American author David Foster Wallace:"
"‚ÄúThe so-called ‚Äòpsychotically depressed‚Äô person who tries to kill herself doesn‚Äôt do so out of quote ‚Äòhopelessness‚Äô or any abstract conviction that life‚Äôs assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire‚Äôs flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It‚Äôs not desiring the fall; it‚Äôs terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt!‚Äô and ‚ÄòHang on!‚Äô, can understand the jump. Not really. You‚Äôd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.‚Äù"
He took his own life sometime after‚Ä¶
"That really isn't the case.  Remember, most people who are interrupted in a suicide attempt don't try again, and if a loved one was with them they would definitely attempt to interrupt the attempt."
"That‚Äôs not true. You can be hurting very, very bad and still have people that love you. This is a dangerous myth to be sharing."
That's pretty intrusive for single people who like to travel alone and visit neat things.
But that policy was introduced after the last 3 suicides and it didn‚Äôt stop this one from happening‚Ä¶
I don‚Äôt think someone who is contemplating suicide is worried about having to spend the extra money for a 2nd ticket
I think they don‚Äôt let you in unless you‚Äôre in a group. Unfortunately I think this last incident involved a kid who was visiting with his family.
"It's pretty intrusive, and it also failed to prevent this suicide just a few weeks after the policy was introduced, so it's not effective either."
"You're not going to get to a point of zero suicides, just reduce the frequency. It honestly seems like a cool reputation to have that people are literally dying to visit your building."
Which is garbage bc I love going places by myself.
"I take whole trips by myself, and love it. I can come and go as I please, take as much time on individual activities as I like without anyone rushing me, and can eat what I want without juggling a bunch of dietary restrictions or pickiness."

Hold up: they charge an entry fee to walk up and down stairs?
Yes
Are you really that surprised that an installation like that might charge an entrance fee?
I assumed it was a public park sort of thing. But lol at myself for na√Øvet√©.
It was free but now it costs $10 because apparently suicidal people won't pay $10 to kill themselves
"When I visited, the timed tickets were free. They used tickets to control the crowding, not to make money. Even at $10, it's a bargain considering most NYC attractions are quite a bit more expensive."
There is an elevator if you prefer to take that up and walk down. Shame that it's going to be closed due to the acts of a few people.

"Billioniare owner (after the fifth suicide), ""Apparently nothing works, so we are shutting it down."""
How is the 10$ fee supposed to convince people not to kill themselves?
It‚Äôs inconvenient.
Very
"If you didn‚Äôt plan for that as being there during your attempt, then it will at the very least postpone your attempt and allow you to rethink or seek help. Suicide attempts have been stopped by things as simple as getting distracted by a person walking by. But yes, the people who jumped likely planned for the fee."
"‚ÄúWell, of people are going to kill themselves here, we might as well profit from it!‚Äù"

I mean if I was gonna kill myself I wouldn't pay 10 dollars for it not gonna lie.  Seems like a somewhat useful deterrent

"Installing a slide would be more effective, contemplating suicide is way harder when you're having fun."

"Literally a guy said in a ted talk (or maybe just a motivational speech on YouTube) that he literally decided not to kill himself because a lady held a door open for him at the entrance to the building and said good morning, and said ""How are you?*"
He was only going into that building to jump off it.
He said it stopped him for a moment as he had to think.
"He said he didn't tell her, but he thought about it properly himself."
"So I make it a point to say ""How's your morning going"" instead of hello to my coworkers."
You never know.
"I once called a suicide hotline at 4AM, ready to off myself from a bridge. I figured I might as well, never called one before."
"Turns out the only hotline opened at that time was for teenagers, which the person promptly informed me after asking my age (23 at the time). They told me the adult hotline would open in a few hours and that they could give me their number, but they unfortunately couldn't help me. I sighed loudly into the receiver and said ""No, nevermind, it won't matter then"", then hung up."
"I stood in the cabin for a good minute, processing what just happened, then busted out laughing. Of course, I would be turned down from a fucking suicide hotline, so goddamn typical."
"I must've been laughing in tears for something like 5 whole minutes when I decided to walk back home, chuckling along the way. In a weird, backwards way, that phone call probably saved my life, this was peak comedy, you can't make that shit up, how could I kill myself while hysterically laughing at how ridiculous my life became. In that moment, Eric Idle's lyrics came to me as clear as day and changed my perspective on life."
I do feel bad for the volunteer on the other end though. That must've been a rough call to take from their point of view.

Is that suicidal ideation ideation?

Something like from Dostoevsky.
"Some just want attention, even if for one fleeting second."

"Set up a skeet shooting facility at the bottom. Suicide rates will plummet, homocide rates will fly!"
How silly. Just use it as a good place to deliver mental health services awareness or something. You don‚Äôt stop suicidal people by banning a building. Has the suicide rate in the city spiralled out of control? Probably not.
"It's more complicated than that. There's a bridge in Korea where suicide is popular. The news reported on it and suicide rates increased. So they put up signs saying ""please call this hotline if you're thinking bout suicide"" and suicide rates increased. So they put up happy statements talking about how great life is thinking it would cheer people up. And suicide rates increased."
"As for the suicide rate and stopping suicidal people, that's no one's concern. The issue is that regular suicides are bad for business for the attraction and for surrounding areas. It also opens the company up to liability. No one thinks that getting rid of the building is going to somehow stop suicides. It's more a ""not in my back yard"" issue."
So they put up happy statements talking about how great life is thinking it would cheer people up
"As someone with suicide ideation, this type of shit makes me want to kill myself even more, maybe with some bystander violence thrown in out of spite."
"For me it's the opposite, but the same result. If I was really suicidal and then had a spike of  contentment I'd think ""this is a good note to end it on""."
My point is if you can attract suicidal people to a particular place it makes it much easier to stop them doing it. Like that guy that keeps stopping people jumping off a particular bridge.
"Is the Korean rate going up because of the bridge? Suicide in Japan and Korea is pretty high I think, but I don‚Äôt think bridges are causing it."
Make a permanent mental health patrol.
The attempts at stopping suicide at the bridge was attracting more suicides to the bridge. Whether the bridge was causing suicides overall to increase is too complicated of a question for anyone to really answer. We don't have a control universe without the bridge to compare.
"Who would ""make a permanent mental health patrol""? From what I can tell it's owned by a private company. I really don't think a real estate company wants to get into the completely new field of ""vigilante suicide prevention as a service"". Once again, the liability alone for something like that is a legal and ethical can of worms I don't think any serious organization would want to get into."
One guy sitting on a bridge doing a thing is very different than a corporation providing mental health services in a public venue.
"I'm saving ""control universe"" for some future fiction writing, thanks."

You're telling me celebrity suicides are more known?? Wowww I never would've guessed
"Look up notable suicides. There's plenty of people on there who you've never heard of, who had more money than you or I ever will."
"""notable suicides"" when rich fucks offs themselves its notable, when poor people do it, its a statistic. do rich people kill themselves?  yes. do they anywhere near as much as poor people? no."
"Yes. People of note, who again, you may not have heard of, but are still proof that you can't buy mental health"
"doesn't matter poor people do it more, and money doesn't buy mental heath. it buys stability and therapy though"
Of course poor people do it more. Poor people do everything more. There's more of them. Poor people buy more Hondas than rich people. Poor people eat more oatmeal than rich people. That's like saying more Chinese people commit suicide than white people in China.
Obviously but not having money makes people a lot more sad.
It shouldn‚Äôt be the companies responsibility to have to tackle the social issue of suicide.
""
"There's a very simple, easy, and humane way to fix this problem. Much like safe injection sites help people who are absolutely going to take drugs do it in a safe place; we need safe suicide providers. Euthenising people who want it. I guarantee that standing up on a bridge and jumping is an incredibly terrifying, traumatic, and lonely way to die. People are going to do it though. Wouldn't you rather your loved ones, even just people you see in the street if they were going to die by suicide do it in a safe, calm environment."
Just don‚Äôt sell single tickets. They shouldn‚Äôt l have to deliver a public service.
Or just raise the railing so people can‚Äôt jump over it.
That is like banning kitchen knives to stop people stabbing each other. You just keep building higher and higher railings instead of dealing with the problem.
This sounds like it‚Äôd be the logical position but studies on locations like bridges show it‚Äôs actually not correct in the real world. The Golden Gate Bridge is a great example.
"Of course, and once the owner bans people using it nobody will have to ban anything and you will have plenty more time to study reading comprehension."
Another foolish error by you. I logged into my account probably after six days not using it and immediately corrected your error. And now I have corrected another error. You are like a faulty robot with a broken wheel going round in circles.
"No it isn‚Äôt, otherwise you wouldn‚Äôt have felt the need to try to have the last word when you are wrong, which means now you have resorted to lying to compound your wrong, which just leaves the final humiliation of you deciding whether or not to try again."
"If I was gonna jump off a building, I would totally choose this one too"
"Could someone explain what the point of this thing is?  Looking at the pictures, I can't fathom why anyone would want to use it."
"It‚Äôs an interactive architectural sculpture. It sounds stupid, I thought it would be a dumb Instagram tourist trap. But in person it is pretty impressive."
"For one thing, you are very high up in open air, and it feels much higher from the top. While it is not as tall as an observation deck like Top of the Rock or the ESB, it is just tall enough to still feel real, where as sometimes the obs decks are so tall they feel surreal."
The architectural part feels very unique as well. Once you get inside and start climbing you realize you have never been in a structure like it before. That part does feel surreal.
Your comment that it feels real vs surreal makes sense to me.  Thank you.
Thanks for the explanation. I was looking for this.
This is why we can't have nice things.
"Let's be real, that building is not a nice thing to begin with."
"It's beautiful and mind bending, but not to everyone's taste. Thank goodness it was a private development. When you have developments with too much public opinion, you end up with fugly contraptions like the new WTC. That shit looks like a power station."
"Is it? I feel like the endless staircase to nowhere set in a soulless shopping center was a little too on the nose. It's just endless influencers and death, with no real utility or function. Sure it's a beehive, but buildings shaped like other things isn't really exciting either.  New Yorkers get enough of steel and staircases as it, I see nothing new, innovative or particularly inspiring in this thing. It just takes up a lot of space to emphasize how expensive and purposeless it is."
"I suspect you think the High Line is a pointless walk to designer stores, especially when you can walk on the streets and get there in less time? Or would you prefer another glass tower in that plaza?"
"No, it is outdoor space, with greenery, walking areas and is fairly accessible. It seems very obvious how different the two things are."
"The building has proven itself to be a failure. The architecture, the circumstances, it has all come together to be a blight on NYC. That in itself is an indicator that whatever was hoped for, hasn't worked out. Unless the goal was suicides and jokes about it being a death tower was the goal? Otherwise we can unequivocally say, this project was not a success."
"So sad to hear. This is an incredible adult jungle gym, no one builds things like this anymore. Can  netting/ fences be put in place, a la Goldengate Bridge?"
"This is what I thought. An incredible shame since it was amazing to climb up when I visited a few years ago. The zigzag staircases looked trippy af, and the view from the top at sunset was unbelievably beautiful. Hope they find a decent solution that doesn‚Äôt involve shutting the whole thing down."
No one builds things like it anymore? It was started in 2017 and opened in 2019

"I mean if you‚Äôre going to do that, you‚Äôre going to do that anyway."
All the research on suicide actually indicates the exact opposite.  Suicide attempts depend strongly on opportunity.
"Oh I get that, I‚Äôm just saying that there are countless opportunities of the same sort, none of which I am going to list, that don‚Äôt require a public art structure."
I just people will avoid having a pillar of public suicide in the middle of their city.
It's be more like a mound than a Pillar
Just put a sign at the entrance. A disclaimer. Not responsible for suicides.
Warning: You have fall damage enabled
"I am not a fan of the design after living near it for a couple years,, but I don't necessarily blame the architecture. If a human wants to climb over a fence or wall to jump they will. The hanging garden idea in the comments is interesting as it could integrate the design at a human scale and provide safety. However as a architectural designer I hate the argument 'just raise th fences' because they did and surprise someone found a way over, they even have a rule you can't go to this by yourself ( which is another bag of worms )."
isnt water becomes a concrete if you jump on it high enough
I guess we should close all train stations and large bridges too? This is lame. That is a really nice piece of art and architecture.
The building give me Dead Space vibes.
It gave the jumpers dead space vibes also.

If you only build down somewhere there is gonna be a staircase long enough to jump down

"Life is a characteristic that distinguishes physical entities that have biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased (they have died), or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria."

Wait what‚Äôs the point in that building?
What the with people having that much energy to climb the up there just to jump to your death? Laziness is the only thing keeping me alive.
"I know suicide is typically done when people aren't in their most calm and cooled state, but honestly you just be a selfish fucking prick to kill yourself ON someone's accomplishment, or in traffic, etc."

What if they put a decorative lake around it with fountains? Would look good - a lot harder to kill yourself by falling into.

"EDIT: Reply below me is most probably correct, most Egyptologists conclude that the pyramids were built by ordinary workers who couldn't work other jobs like the fields during times of flooding."
Hey! It was a public works project that provided a lot of jobs!
shame none of those jobs were paid
Now you‚Äôre splitting hairs‚Ä¶
Beat me to it
"The slaves were beaten, too!"
I thought I read that they discovered that the pyramids were built by paid construction crews and not slaves. I'm too lazy to look it up though.
"All that was installed well after it was planned and built. Its sole concept is to be a 300m-high tower, with no purpose other than showing man can build it."
"Also, I think you exaggerate a bit with the devices on it ‚Äì it‚Äôs still primarily a touristic site. There are no bars, and only one restaurant on it. There are some meteorological probes along with antennas, but there is no lab on it. And what do you mean by ships?"
Shops that sell Eiffel Tower merchandise on the Eiffel Tower don‚Äôt really build the case for it not being a pure vanity building.
The Eiffel tower was originally planned to be dismantled after 30 years.
"""The Mona Lisa is a pointless waste of paint and canvas. Why didn't Da Vinci just use the canvas for a satchel or use the paint to cover graffiti? Pure vanity project. Unrelated note, I don't understand art."""

The elevator is for handicapped persons that want to take a photo on top. Otherwise I think you can't use it.
This building is pure genius. So many platforms to jump from
I‚Äôm not sure that‚Äôs actually help anything more than the location right?
Just bought my one-way ticket on southwest...thanks for posting.
Ayy I've been here
I had to read the title 5 times to understand. Capital letters have rules!
Wonderfull architact
Good fuckin riddance
I bet most these people don't think about the fact that dying is hard.
"Gunshot to the head, could takes minutes or longer to die."
"Falling, be crippled up, brain damage or long death."
Why are people going here to kill themselves instead of one of the many other locations they could go on NY?
Just make suiciding illegal. That‚Äôll work
Asshole. Between the likely mess to be cleaned up because of this and the fact that this had to be closed for this very reason idk why they chose this place.
"I've been there before, and to someone who's been afraid of heights for forever, it can be stressful. I didn't know people actually died there, its a little terrifying to me."
"Is a pretty nice tourist attraction tho, a lot of stairs but very pretty. Just like don't do.... that."
You simply can't have such accessible jumping spots. Suicide prevention should have been a part of the initial design. People that want notoriety in death will use high profile spots so they can get splashed on the front pages.
"The vessel fucking sucks, Hudson yards fucking sucks - me, the exterior facade consultant"
"What does that mean, you consulted on the copper on the underside?"
Railing height my friend - the Vessel meets NYC building code but we advised them to be higher
Is the current railing 42‚Äù?
A believe it‚Äôs a bit higher because it‚Äôs 42‚Äù at the lowest stair height which would mean the typical horizontals are a touch higher
Fuck these people. Ugh I'm gonna kill myself and inconvenience and ruin this attraction for everyone else. I'm glad these wastes are dead.
Seven less Democrat voters?
Considering you said that I‚Äôm not surprised you can‚Äôt count
What a dumb structure anyway
RIP to the dead people but hopefully they do take this monstrosity down. I‚Äôve never understood it‚Äôs appeal to people
"yeah it isn't ""pc"" because it's a shit take lol"
It‚Äôs not even a troll account. We‚Äôve got an actual lunatic here. Thats worryingly sad
when are people going to realize their values / bullshit doesn't always apply to others...
"ie, weak?  dude, it takes some crazy strength to carry out the act, you can't deny such.  wowzers."
"really wish people would stop with the whole moralizing of this issue, kind of like forty or fifty years ago when everybody just ""knew"" that gay people were mentally ill supposedly, well that's obvious bs, kind of like making assumptions on this topic to begin with -"
"then again, i probably agree with you on the specifics, i don't want to live in a world where everything fun and cool is shut down or banned because someone else might mis-use it, yet that seems to be the way we are heading."
"As someone that struggles with stairs (hip issues causing mobility problems, not a lazy obese individual), even with this building looking beautiful, it also looks like a personal hell designed just for me."
"Wouldn't stop me from ever having the privilege of experiencing this architectural master-piece. Would just need to ensure I have sufficient pain-killer on hand and access to a hot bath after-wards. And well if I'm in hell, hot water should be easy to find, right?"
There‚Äôs an elevator fwiw
"Yeah I know, but when I said; ""I would like to experience it"". To me the experience is in the navigation of walking around the maze of stairs, over getting to the top for the view."
Liberals: you can do whatever you want as long as it doesn‚Äôt hurt others
Why yes lets politicise someone being driven to take their own life!!! Awesome job keep it up man!! (Tf is wrong with yall)
Why is suicide a bad thing?
Shut the fuck up.
Don't let those silly geese ruin it for everyone.
"People say that safety regulations have become too strict these days, which might have some truth to it. But obviously people can‚Äôt behave and use every single construction to brainstorm ending it or some shit. Unbe-fucking-lievable."
Why aren‚Äôt their crisis counselors there or some kind of suicide prevention outreach?
Because who the fuck would do that?
Where?
"Is this building a tribute to baseball catchers, or hockey goalies?"
Where‚Äôs the flight attendant?
"Wow , what a pointless building."
It's art
Just put big bags of sponge underneath.
Why tho?
"I'd like to jump off there, if I'm gonna do it, might as well do it with style"
I hope they don‚Äôt close the structure. I really want to visit it one day
TBH I‚Äôm not Suicidal but something about that design makes me want to jump off it.
Suicide booth out the front would work.
Designed by Ivo Shandor
so useless
""
Read the article that says that they are lobbying for higher barriers because of this suicide. Not sure how higher barriers would stop people who have already decided to commit suicide. A net would be better.
"Why not just enclose it like they did with the Empire state building?   People would jump from the building all the time.   Or do like they do on the freeways,  put fences so no one can drop boulders, or themselves, onto the drivers of other freeways, parkways, highways etc."
That's sad as fuck. And so many people get traumatized by that happening in front of them. Jesus
""
Thats beautiful architecture
There are plenty of other things to jump off of if one is inclined to.
When i worked in the water tower mall in chicago it happened. Kind of the same deal it had an open center to the bottom food court area. I guess it happened enough but according to my store owner no one made it to the bottom.
We just can't have nice things.  People...
"Pls dont bully me internet people, but just wondering, is 4 suicides a lot for this kind of building/attraction ?"
"For how long it's been there, the population density and how many people can get to it within 2 days drive I would say no,"
"""TOO MANY STAIRS"" - Hulk"
It looks more like a stage rather than an Evil Building.
"If you build it, they will jump."
"It is unlikely to increase suicides by existing, why shutter it?"
It is literally flanked by buildings people could use for the same purpose
"This reminds me of the building in I, Robot - weirdly, that kicks off with a deadly fall as well."
"sui's a-cide, that looks like pretty rad installation."
Wow
Well... I guess I'm changing my vacation plans.
Why don't they just ask if people are going to jump?
Wherefore they not just asketh if 't be true people art going to jump?
I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.
""
Good bot.
Have they not heard of nets?
Wait till monday when 7 millions of people get evicted. The number might double by the end of the day.
Im going to go against the grain on this.  Thats an awfully nice place to kill ones self.  Not like they cant do it elsewhere in a less pleasing setting.
I thought it was built as a set for that famous chainsmokers song
No wonder...
It has a landing pad.
"Cool, but useless. They could‚Äôve done something more innovating with that money."
I'm trying to figure out why this thing exactly has become the place to go...
I live beside a suicide magnet in Toronto; the prince edward viaduct. After reducing the suicide numbers with a barrier the bridge is a lot more safer. Something like that needs to happen here and can even improve the look of this structure if done properly.
What is this place ?
"As a recently mental illness hospitalized person, I can say that this building is very suicidable. Like an SMART car suicide building."
What a great place to kill yourself
Woah
or just let people die. it's not the buildings fault
Fucking Shwarma
"Dang, guess I better move quick on that suicide."
According to Wikipedia it's closed indefinitely.
This is such a pretty place to die. I bet its like falling through a kaleidoscope
Did they jump in or out though?
I wanna go.
"Looks like a fun place to die, tbh"
The security has good harassment training If you  are a certain demographic and can't prove your a tourist...
Looks like something Josh from Let's Game It Out would do
I thought that they had already closed it. I guess I was wrong.
Today I learned there‚Äôs a sun called evil buildings
It‚Äôs sad I find this spectacle so amusing like stop with these weird art projects they just end up being suicide tools. They keep it open for $$$ but at the cost of lives.
""
Glass installation and glass cleaning companies should team up and offer to sponsor a full glass covering.. it would make for great PR‚Ä¶ and suicide awareness‚Ä¶
Hmm not a bad idea seems super easy to jump over
Awesome now the problem will be fixed
Why not build a moat around it with real lifeguard alligators?
Looks like the type of structure you can take good photos of but then when you get up it; it's underwhelming.
I wonder if he hated the view from half way down?
What a waste of space
Paint it blue

"Let's be honest here, until suicidal people can access safe, non traumatic services to end their lives they will be forced to go through horrific ways to end their lives. And the rest of you can just put up with it."
"Honestly can see why, I don't even have the motivation to climb the stairs up to my flat, fuck that I'd be taking the easy way down, my legs hurt"
Saw this picture some months ago and honestly wondered how many suicides it would take before they shut it down. Is there no fencing around the sides?
That's way to easy to jump/fall off
"Oh, great.  Better shut down the Golden Gate Bridge, then.  Or figure out a better solution."
All the people trashing this thing feel like the same people that would've complained about the Eiffel Tower when it was built
The fuck is even the point of this monstrosity?
"The big question is, do you give it some effort and make a leap towards the center or take the easy out and just lean over the outside?"
The design is perfect for jumping off the ledge.. tbh
"Weird, ive had nightmares abt being stuck on a building like this an d ive never seen it"
"Thank you for the hug! That was nice of you. I know & realize that this kid felt the pain he was feeling was just unbearable and he had to to go. I wish he didn't do it in front of his mother, father, sister & grandmother. That's why I feel bad because of the people left behind."
the geometry looks both vertigo and existential inducing...oh and the height
"I mean, if you were gonna do it, this definitely looks like the place. It‚Äôs just all stairs and windows."
What's the point of that anyway?
Also imagine building a structure like that and planting no trees or shrubs like wtf
I thought this was already closed to the public for the same reason
"That looks like a fantastic building to kill myself from/on. If I were to suicide off any building, it would be this one."
Oh shit. I saw a video where someone did a walkthrough of this structure. My first thought was that people were going to jump. I'm sad that's actually the case
That entire area is fucked.  The pandemic demolished it.
To be fair it looks really tempting. Look at that architecture.
This is so sad :(
"yes, its the buildings fault that some depressed kid jumped from it. Im sure families of future victims will appreciate the fact that their child got splattered by a train instead."
NYC: the city of pointless and expensive projects
It's kinda cool but also kinda pointless.
Is this what art is?
We just can't have nice things
I‚Äôve definitely had nightmares about this exact building
Wish i could be the fifth
Beautiful place to do it
"Maybe not take your suicidal kid to a suicide hotspot? Either way building should be condemned. Not because of suicides, but because of its lack of ADA accessibility."
"Yes... Close the building, don't address the underlying issues... Sounds about right."
Beautiful. so glad there's an elevator.
Imagine shoveling the snow in the winter.
So this kid had a history of attempted suicides and his family took him on a day trip to the suicide structure??
No offence but god what an ugly building
Are we really gonna blame a building for suicides? C‚Äômon people‚Ä¶.
I saw this in an chainsmoker's song video . Song name : takeaway
"well shit, better get my tickets now"
you would think after the first one they would shut it down
"Just put soft pillows around it, problem solved."
"God, there was my chance to kill myself and I missed it"
"God, thither wast mine own chance to killeth myself and i did miss t"
I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.

Good bot
May shutter? What?
"Beautiful building-er, if you could call it that, but yeah, absolute suicide magic. People are more important than aesthetic."
"What an incredibly useless structure. Well, I guess it‚Äôs good for one thing at least."
Oh we're talking EVIL evil buildings now
"/s I really hope that they can find a way to prevent this, and help the folks who are in that kind of a position."
It's interesting how they managed to perfectly materialize the feeling of oppression with a building.
""
Holy shit. So that's why it's always closed
