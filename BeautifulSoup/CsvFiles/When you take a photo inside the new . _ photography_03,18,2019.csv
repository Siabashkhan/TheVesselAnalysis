"You can't enforce illegal contracts, but what about what they are claiming do you think would be illegal for them to do?  If you enter into a legal contract for something you can legally do, why would it not be enforceable?"
"Because its an adhesion contract and are often found at least partially unenforceable sense one party has almost all the bargaining power. The point of these contracts isn't to be rock solid, but to prevent an unsophisticated party from even trying to fight it."
Adhesion contracts are usually enforceable in the United States since the Uniform Commercial Code is followed by most American states
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/adhesion-contract.asp
"Adhesion contracts are most of the time held to be enforceable, but you are right, they can be held to a higher level of scrutiny.  But considering if they wanted to, being private property they could 100% ban all photography, that would be their solution if it ever came to a fight about it."
"In this case, this term seems to lack consideration. You're allowed to take photos, but they immediately become The Vessel's property (with full commercial rights) with no consideration to you, and you waive your own commercial rights? Even fair use would let you sell them. Not to mention unlimited transferability between parties and types of media, and lack of termination rights. And the limited rights property owners have to photographs of their property in the first place."

"This reads more like ""we own the photograph and you have a non-commercial license"", but written to avoid copyright law by listing everything out longhand."
"In this case, this term seems to lack consideration. You're allowed to take photos, but they immediately become The Vessel's property (with full commercial rights) with no consideration to you, and you waive your own commercial rights?"
"They do not claim ownership, they claim a license to use.  And the consideration is entry to the art project.  Being a ticketed event that they can refuse you entry without a ticket, your consideration is the ticket to enter.  That is why their terms and coditions you agree to says"
"In consideration for being permitted to enter the Vessel, an interactive staircase and art installation located at Hudson Yards, provided and/or operated by ERY Vessel LLC (“Company”), I, on behalf of myself and my participating minor child/children, if any, agree to the following:"
Even fair use would let you sell them.
"And you could, as long as you were not selling for commercial purposes.  They are not claiming ownership or copyright, just a license to use."
"Could you strike out the word ""agree"" at the top of the ticket terms and make the whole AC void/unenforceable?"
"Nope, because if you don't agree and enter, you are now a trespasser"
Is there something in the terms talking about who is authorized to modify and accept modifications? Otherwise you're free to edit as you see fit and the company agrees when they accept the ticket. A
Otherwise you're free to edit as you see fit and the company agrees when they accept the ticket
That's not how it works.
So they can come after you for trespassing but not get rights to your photo.
"Wouldnt any sale be a commercial purpose? I mean once you cross into selling it, isnt it no longer for personal use and has become a commercial use? Genuinely asking what the difference here is."
"It's all about what the law considers commercial use. Selling a photo as art is still personal use, up to 200ish copies. After that it falls into commercial use. Or if you sell or license it to be used for advertising or promotions, that is commercial."
"It might be private property but their agreement with the city requires it to be open to the public. I'm in agreement that this clause is arbitrary and won't ever be enforced, just ignore it."
Being open to the public does not mean public property.
"The UCC doesn't apply here. These tickets aren't goods and this isn't a sale since they're given for free, you're simply reserving an invitation to enter the area."
I have never seen a case that the UCC was considered not to apply due to the item being sold was at no actual dollar cost.  Do you have examples that show that to be the case?
Because you also agree to a model release with your ticket.  By entering you agree not only to a visual model release but audio recordings as well.
My understanding is the contract would be illegal as there is no benift for the photographer.
"Their benefit is entry to the structure.  Cost to enter is zero, but you must have a ticket to enter."
But you're allowed to enter without giving them photos as well. So that doesn't hold up.
You give up more than just a license to any photos or artworks you take/make there. Both sides have consideration and get value out of the agreement.
"They don't claim ownership to the pictures, by entering  and taking the pictures you agree to give them a royalty free license.  Ownership stays with the photographer."
"And once again they are not charging, they are trading entry for a license.  If you don't want to give a license you don't enter."
Looking forward to seeing what happens when someone who never entered takes a photo from the street and they claim ownership.
"Nothing in this is claiming ownership, just a license to use."
Royalty free - forever... worldwide... photographer can never make money from it...
"Granting them a royalty free license does not mean you cannot monetize it, just that you can't charge them for it. Is there a separate clause stopping monetization?"
"Yes, the last sentence in the section OP posted prohibits you from monetizing it."
photographer can never make money from it.
Where do you see that in the Terms?
The final sentence of the term in the OP requires the Company's prior written consent (and no limitations on how the Company can grant or withhold that consent) to use the media for any commercial purpose.
"Commercial purposes in this context does not mean you can't sell prints or copies of your work, it is referring to advertising. You can take pictures and sell it's either 200 or 250 copies of it as art before they could say anything."
I don’t think that’s how the last part works.
Buying a ticket for something isn't exactly the same as signing a contract for a house or something. You can't reasonably expect the same level of enforceability or awareness.
"I'm certainly no lawyer, but I don't see that it's reasonable that they ask me to give up rights to photos I took because I bought a ticket for an event. It's not a reasonable expectation when you purchase a ticket."
"Places do it all the time, because they are private property.  Look at the number of places that prevent you from even bringing in a camera.  They can do so because it is private property.  If you don't like their policies, you aren't forced to go there."
"They can reasonably prevent you from bringing your camera, sure. They can prohibit photography altogether, yes."
But claiming licensing rights of creative works which you made with your own camera on their property is a completely different claim!
"EDIT: If you visit my house, I can't claim ownership of photos you took while at my house, for example."
"If you make the condition to me before I enter, that if I take pictures inside your house that I am going to grant you a license to do so in exchange for my entry, that is as far as I know a perfectly valid contract to make.  Both people are getting something from the agreement and it isn't illegal to do."
Being the property owner you could even make me apply and pay for a license to take pictures if you wanted to.  I just shot at a historical site and had to pay them money to even take my camera on their property.
"I have the legal ability to grant licenses to the photos I take under copyright law, you have the legal right to demand payment for me to enter, I am legally allowed to pay for that right to enter with a license to pictures I take.  Don't enter into legal contracts if you don't agree to them..."
"Except they are granting entrance to everyone, not just people who give them photos. So the idea of entrance as consideration for the licensing agreement in this contract is bullshit."
"They are getting more than just photo licenses for their consideration, it is just part of what they get in exchange for you going in."
"Oh, come on. I wonder if most people who visit this place (""The Vessel"") even know what the ticket says."
Buying a ticket with text on it is not the same as explicitly agreeing to a condition up-front.
"Now, if the argument you are going to make is they aren't doing enough to inform people of this clause in order to enter, I can't speak one way or another about it, and doubt you could either.  If there was someone who had been there that can check to see if there are signs informing as such, I can tell you the terms are easily found on their website, they are right there with the content, not hidden in small print at the bottom."
"Look, this isn't new. Concert promoters have been trying this for a few years. It's a straight-up rights grab."
"It's only ""legal"" if we roll over and don't fight it in the courts."
http://blog.jeremynicholl.com/2011/03/07/dear-photographers-lady-gaga-wants-the-copyright-on-your-work-oh-and-by-the-way-so-do-we/
"And if it was unenforceable, do you think since its been going on for a few years we would have a couple of court cases where it has been thrown out?"
"Also keep in mind the difference here is they are not asking for ownership, they are getting a license to use."
Wait a second though. Stealing my photo is not legal! That’s my point.
You can't steal something if the person has agreed to give you a license to use it.  Agreeing to license a picture to someone is a legal activity.

"You don't buy the tickets, tickets are free."
And that is covered by
"In consideration for being permitted to enter the Vessel, an interactive staircase and art installation located at Hudson Yards, provided and/or operated by ERY Vessel LLC (“Company”), I, on behalf of myself and my participating minor child/children, if any, agree to the following:"
Your use of the ticket to enter is accepting their terms.  You can reserve a ticket and not accept their conditions by not entering.
Fair point !
"Seems likely that the way they would enforce it is to make photographers sue to challenge after they've used the ""license"" to justify stealing the photo. Maybe you could win, but at what cost? They are likely betting that many will opt not to fight them."
"Exactly, they want free promotional material, so they want everyone to take pictures, and then you will have to fight to get them to take down your own picture."
"Sure, but how is that different from them just using the image without permission, and not putting any text in the ticket?"
"One way they have a license, the other they are infringing on copyright."
Just text on a ticket doesn't make it legal.
"While you're right, the bar for something rendering a contract invalid is pretty high. Straight up illegal stuff, like turning over your firstborn, would render it invalid."
"A shitty assignment clause for intellectual property almost guaranteed wouldn't. The arbitration clause is more likely to be a problem for this contract than the IP assignment, and even the arbitration clause seems legal in my opinion."
“Litterers will be murdered.”
"You have to be more vague about the implications, you can't just straight up threaten someone with murder. You can say ""Litterers will die"" and that's fine, because everyone dies at some point so you aren't wrong, and you aren't directly threatening to kill someone, but the implication is still there."
Crafty.
"A lot of museums, aquariums, and other historical places have similar terms.  Private property, you either play by their rules or don't go."
"The thing is, they don't want to go after the people, they want the people to take the pictures, then they get to advertise with the pictures.  A Kardashian goes and takes an insta selfie there, well now they get to use that picture on their social media and ads.  Its the ultimate in free adverting."
"This is the key. ☝️ They aren’t restricting the photographer’s right to take the image (though they are restricting the right to sell it). They’re saying, “If we find an image depicting (whatever) out in the world, we get to use it in whatever manner we choose and for whatever purpose we choose.” Which, practically speaking, means they can use it for advertising and promotional purposes without paying the photog or, I’d imagine, even giving credit."
""
"Didn't really think about this angle where they don't want to prevent people from profitting of the establishment, but they want to share the publicity/marketing."
"Ironically, it would probably be easier for a Kardashian to invalidate this contract than it would be for a random, unknown person."
So by the Kardashians posting it they are adding maybe more value?    Can you go into that?
"No, the argument would be more than their likeness is so valuable that a unilateral, non-negotiated contract for the assignment would be unconscionable in their case."
"My likeness is worth ""nothing"", so I don't have that argument. Their likeness is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars for a single Instagram post."
"Which says everything about how fucked up our society has become, but that's a very different discussion."
"They're not trying to prevent you from taking photos. They're making sure they can use your photos for whatever they want, without asking for your permission or paying you."
"Most sports stadiums now are mostly taxpayer funded, and that similar language has been printed on tickets for a long time. At least the part about you not being able to sell the photos without their consent."
It doesnt say its exclusive at least.
"only if you buy a ticket. if you break in an enter, you are under no such contract."
"But just remember it could be worse, at least we have the right to take picture of it at all.  In some countries it would be considered under copyright and not be able to be photographed legally at all without a license."
This building was literally designed to be an Instagram trap.
And that is why they want all the free pictures and videos to use for free advertising.
It's private property and the owners can prohibit photography if they want.  It's not that unusual.

Watermark your images before you post them. The company won't touch them.
Diagonally across the whole thing... in red.
Use the <blink> tag!
"I agree with all these comments about it being private property, and you have to follow the rules.. but if 1 cent of tax payer money was used, this shouldn't be enforceable. Speaking morally of course.. legally I assume it would have to go to court to finding how enforceable it actually is."
why is copyright enforcement different if it is publicly or privately funded?  Government gives grants to many of artists and authors to create copyrighted material.
"IMO, a publicly funded structure, particularly one that seems to be open to the general public, should be able to be photographed without the photographer forfeiting exclusive control over their intellectual property."
"I understand not everyone is going to agree with this. Personally, I don’t feel that strongly about it.  I actually think this is a stupid move on the business part.  If photographers have to forfeit their incentive to photograph there, other than personal use, why would they?  I wonder how many images of this building are on Getty compared to a similar building without these terms and conditions."
"Why would that be?   Tax payer money is used for a lot of private things, that doesn't make them public property.  They let the public in for free to view it, and allow you to take pictures in it.  In exchange they want the right to have a license to the pictures you take and share."
Even public property can be used for private events/usage with a permit.
"Yes, but not sure how that is really relevant to the property being private property so the owners being able to restrict photography rights.  Not meaning to sound like a smartass, just curious how you think its related."
It's expanding on the discussion about public property and tax money used to pay for a venue.  Many people seem to think that because a location is public property that a private events are subject to different rules than if they own a location.
Ah... kk :)
"I'm foggy on the details, maybe someone knows: Didn't ""they"" (air quotes here because I'm not sure who. Maybe federal courts?) decide that TOUs are largely unenforceable?"
I would go to one of the bathrooms and take a ton of pics of my Butthole and gladly hand them over.
"I guess I wouldn't really care, so long as I got credit for the shot."
People need to start taking drone photos of the inside so that they're not legally bound by this ticket and the company won't know which photos online they're allowed to steal or not.
Minus all that pesky legalities about flying a drone outside line of sight  and the whole you can only fly drones in NYC at 5 park locations otherwise everywhere else is restricted...
"Royal Botanical Gardens in Ontario, Canada had a sign saying something like that at the Rock Garden entrance last spring."
You should sell photos of their ticket.  That doesn't appear to be included in the contract.
"Wow, and I thought Dairy Queen was bad for their non-disclosed ""no photography"" policy! If I compose a poem while at The Vessel, do they get that too?"
Land of the free
Seems double stupid to me since: A. There's no signed contract when buying a ticket. B. As a photographer I'd be happy to allow them to use any photo I take of their actual property.
"A signed contract is not needed to enter a legally binding agreement with someone.  As a required step to get a ticket you agree to the terms and conditions of the ticket, including these terms."
Sincere question : Are those terms transferable in cases such as received from a third party (scalper or gift)?
"Tickets are free, you just have to reserve them and pick them up yourself at the door."
"Unfortunately, the only thing you can hold up if you are sued for trespassing is that contract. So either you agreed to it all of it or none of it. If none of it then ""what are you doing on my property you pesky kids?"""
""
Isn't that what Facebook does?
"When you upload any pictures of yours, you grant them the rights to use and exploit them for whatever cause and for all eternity, or something..."
"Shoot the shit out of it from public property, for spite."
"If the building is privately owned, even if taxpayer funds were used, the owners have the right to prohibit ALL photography without written permission.  This, at least gives you the right to photograph at will."
"What would happen if you buy the ticket, cross out the phrase, used the ticket, keep the stub with the cross out as proof, and once they claim they copyright, claim that they still allowed you in even though you crossed it out. By letting you in, have they in fact agreed to your conditions to void the contract?"
Thatsillegal.jpg
What law do you think makes it illegal for two groups who can enter lawfully binding contracts to do so?
They have to be aware of the details of the contract. You can't create a document so long and complicated that most people don't read it and then expect to enforce it.
Have you been there to verify that they do not make it clear about the policies and Terms and conditions?  Because they make it pretty clear on their website about them.
"THere ticket system is garbage too, wtf. I got confirmed this morning and my tickets never showed up in my email. Crock"
"Watermark the photo, that way if they use it because it’s rad you get free exposure. Also most social media sign up agreements say the same thing."
"Just because someone puts a clause into a TOS, even if you agree to it, does not mean it's enforceable."
Yikers
