"Hudson yards could have been the new MSG and we could be building our new Penn station on that site but instead we have a high rent apartments, a luxury mall and a gyro. Great deal"

Quit posting the same HY shit lol
uuuugggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Is this free to go to?
Yes but you have to call it The Shawarma
Shawarma pinecone? Yum!
Double imaginary Internet points if you're eating a shawarma bought across near the subway station while inside it.
You have to get tickets in advanced for a timewindow to go.  The availability varies but it's usually like a week in advanced
If you go on random weekdays you can now get tickets on a pretty short lead time.  When I went last week they were handing out tickets for roughly an hour later.
"Basically, go to the ticket line, get your tickets, then go burn an hour walking around the mall and come down for THE SCHWARMA."
Yes book in advance
"Yeah, as someone said above, it's free, just book it a week in advance on their web portal. Well worth a visit."
Well I just went online and there are no tickets available for the next two weeks.
"You can get same-day tickets if you go in person, but sometimes they're a few hours delayed. I went about two weeks ago in person around 1pm and was able to get a ticket for 6:30pm (I gave it up because I didn't care to kill 5+ hours in HY)."
"I don't think they show as available until 7 days before, and then you have to book it before that day becomes unavailable.  I set a reminder on my calendar. Good luck"
Book tickets....to walk up stairs?
What.
"Well, some people pay money to run in place."

Wait so is it really just a beautiful installment of stairs? Is there a more practical utility to it or no?
It focuses psychic energy. This will create a portal to summon Gozar the Gozarian once enough people shop at Hudson Yards.
It's a stairway to nowhere. Which is oddly fitting for a meaningless monument to nothing built as a lawn ornament for the super rich.

I have yet to visit the Hudson Yards Vessel.
Too bad it looks like a giant metal beehive from the outside.
Why is that a bad thing?
"I dunno, a beehive is not typically thought of as an aesthetic object for serious consideration.  I guess any beauty a beehive has would come from it being imperfect and organic, which is not  the case here."
Also it looks like shit lol
Dumb. Still 1000% unecessary.
Garbage.
