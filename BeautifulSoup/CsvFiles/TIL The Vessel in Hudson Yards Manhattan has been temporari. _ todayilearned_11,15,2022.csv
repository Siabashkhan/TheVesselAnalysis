The Vessel must feed.
"im a new yorker and this made me actually lol for real - it's been so many years, thank you"
The system will supply.
"There's an ""ask a mortician"" episode about it. That's a YouTube channel run by a woman who until recently was running an independent LA funeral home. She's done a lot of interesting death related videos."
Summary:
""
90% of people who survive their attempt never die from suicide
"People ages 14-25 are at higher risk of attempting suicide impulsively, everyone who has died at the vessel is in that age range. Barriers are most effective for this group."
"I didn't watch the entire video, this is just to the middle."
Also a bunch of stuff around the reception of the structure and how the people responsible for it have responded on paper and in reality to the issues etc.
Local library had an event with her as a spokesperson. Seemed cool until you read the fine print and found out it was a zoom call with basically a hundred other places all at once lmao
What's funny is most of those weren't planning on commiting suicide until they saw how ugly the Vessel is.
TIL within a TIL. Saucy.
Well what did they expect?  Suicides at the bottom?
I mean that is usually where people die from a fall.
build a tower for that.
How was that not a foreseen problem?

I mean it's an art installation. Putting up super high guards on every level would change the entire thing.
Sucks that this is a problem
"What about sober guards, maybe those could help?"
Or a functional society. Either one would suffice.
"More complicate than it seems. I was trying to make a joke. Context aside, I have been hurt and sought help. Dial 988"
It's a good joke lol
The problem should've been foreseen though the things an attractive nuisance.
How was that a foreseen problem?
People always be jumping off tall shit.
they killed themselves after having to spend 40-50 dollars just to climb some stairs
That whole development is pretty bleh.
â€¦Idiots?
Everyone else? You don't care that it's being ruined for other people. You're just an egotistical piece of shit.
"Are you having a stroke? If not, your communication skills are lacking friend. Glass house meet stone."
"Akshually, the suicide is the jump occurring at the top, as that is the act a person willfully performs. Everything after that is physics."
And pedantic assholes are NOT appreciated here any more than irony is.
