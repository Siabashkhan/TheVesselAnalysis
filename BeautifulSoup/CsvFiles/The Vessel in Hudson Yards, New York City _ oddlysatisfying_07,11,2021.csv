M.C.Escher would approve
Came here to say this
They closed it because people kept suiciding off it.
I mean if there's a good place to jump it's there
One step closer to a harry potter world
Useless shit for 800 Alex
"Yes. Let's have only ugly, strictly functional architecture. That makes the world a much better and more beautiful place..."
Wonder how much taxpayer dollars were used to build this worthless structure?
"It was funded by Hudson Yards developer Related Companies, a private insitiuion."
"I feel it’s a waste, you don’t, have a great weekend"
"Alright, have a nice weekend aswell"
"Not looking for problems, believe you were the on who responded to me, looking for a problem. I guess you know them personally and all their business dealings, so yo have to defend what you ‘think you know’!!!"
"I just responded by telling you it wasn't tax payer funded. I don't work for them, i just think you're jumping to conclusions about this company with no evidence, and i think they should be assumed innocent untill proven guilty."
"Ok, so just another way for them to ‘wash’ their money!! Makes sense!"
Damn you really have a hard time enjoying things don't you
"What’s enjoyable about that? Look at the poverty and homelessness in that city! But you’re right, poss away more money so the rich can hide all they steal! Jackass"
"Look all im saying is that there is a beautiful piece of architecture, and you have to find something wrong with it. You immediately jumped to it being a waste of tax money, without even knowing if it was tax payer funded. And then after I told you that it wasn't tax payer funded, you then make it about corrupt businesses out of nowhere. Considering you knew nothing about who it was funded by, I doubt you can actually prove the company that funded it is corrupt, steals money, and then hides away the savings in buildings. You're just looking for a reason to have a problem."
It’s going to be dismantled since a few people used it for suicide. You humans ruin everything
"Source? I can't find anything that says that it's being dismantled. It's open now, actually. Was closed for a few months earlier this year, but reopened in May with new guidelines for security (have to buy a ticket now, can only enter in groups - not alone, etc.)."
On let's not get lost in the matrix
spectacular!
It’s not centered. Ugh
