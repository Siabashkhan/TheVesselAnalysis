Is it open to the public? I read that it had closed some time ago because people were committing suicide there. Not sure how long ago that was though.
"It reopened, but you can't go alone anymore."
Wow that's wild that's a rule now because of the jumpers

I'm 14 and this is deep.
"Sure, I'll bite. What's shallow about it; how might it have been better?"
"Pity. If I were to ever go back to New York (last went before 9/11) I would be going with my wife, and she wouldn't be interested in going up there, but I would, so I'd probably want to go up alone."
"It has really great views of….. New Jersey.  You’re not missing much.  The vessel is beautiful, but it is not all that worth the stairs up and down, imo.  Other great things to see here."
New Jersey. You’re not missing much.
You're not much
"Ok, tell me what is so awesome on the river in New Jersey there tough guy?  I didn’t shit on Jersey, just said there isn’t much to look at, right there."
That just means suicidal people have to wait at the bottom until another suicidal person comes along so they can go up together...
Which is good because that could lead to a lasting relationship... a very short lasting relationship.
I think you have to book your visit in advance because it's so popular.
They would be friends for life.
It’s dangerous to go alone.

I mean if this is real then I want to throw myself from the top of that structure.

Thanks for flagging. Too bad its.... not funny?
I went there in early February 2020 and it was open to the public
I remember this from The Chainsmokers song Takeaway
Same.
"I remember seeing it here, and they also have a scene where it’s shown in The Flight Attendant on HBO Max. I never could remember what it was called. Now I know. Neat."
Wasnt the money used for this place supposed to be for lower income areas?
Yes but now we have a pointless structure made entirely of stairs where you can stare at tall ass buildings a couple hundred meters away that block the views in 3 different directions.
"Essentially, it's a $300mill stairmaster that people can yeet themselves off of."
That last sentence. Damn lol
Suicide central
The Steel Shawarma of Self-Harm
I was thinking the same
I went and was underwhelmed. Its honestly overrated and a waste of park space. Its a visually beautiful 360° multi level viewing platform….  Thats surround on 3 sides by buildings taller than it. Why wasn’t this built in like a national park or someplace with something to see from all around? Could’ve also had a better park in that space putting something like the new little island park in there. Something with mixed purpose spaces
"Also cost like 300m to build, pretty insane for what it is."

You have a nice view of Weehawken.
Seeing Weehawken's cute little library as you drive into the city is always fun
"It’s not in a park, it’s in a square next to a mall and office buildings."
"Yeah I went there, it’s pretty sweet. Newly opened in 2019. Really good for photos"
Looks like the galactic senate is about to convene
I want a chase scene in a slasher movie to happen here pronto. Please and thank you.
Can you run
Awful place to be when it rains
"Doesn't nobody in New York like this? Like, no one likes it, I heard."
New Yorker here—can confirm we hate it. The only people who actually bother to go there are tourists.
The Wessel?
Nuclear wessel?
That's rad.
Needs to be used in a foot Chase scene in an action movie
Testing out the new BMW grille I see
Been there. Very pretty. They also had to put guard rails up cause people kept jumping off of it
NYC is such a crazy city I can't wait for the day I get to visit.
bring pepper spray
At least the user name checks out.
Why? Bad neighborhood?
Nah its fine.  Just avoid the bronx.
Stairs that get you nowhere. Wasn't that in a Simpsons episode?
"Biggest bullishit when I tried to get on there. I was excited to walk in but when I arrived, I was given ticket to return in several hours when my turn is next."
Yeah no thanks
I feel so bad for the structural engineer on that project.
"When you finally get downstairs and that little voice in your head says ""wait""."
Where the hell was this when I was training for mountain climbing?
"That's neat, but looks like it would confusing."
I would get so lost..
Looks like a painful exercise machine
But what is it’s purpose?
the batshit crazy thing is it's just an artwork! Even crazier are there are painted artworks which cost more at auction than this Vessel's $200 million price tag
Reminds me of the oil rig the Plant in Metal Gear Solid 2
I got in trouble for blowing bubbles out of a bubblegum there :(
Holy God. May I know the architect who designed this?
Thomas Heatherwick
"Literally so many people have killed themselves jumping off that building, it’s amazing how poorly accounted for suicide was when designing it lmao even security presence hasn’t stopped people"
I'm surprised the accessibility-advocates allowed something like that to be built...
