Nice shot! This spot is already so popular for photos it’s crazy.
Is that natural distortion from the 24-70 GM at the bottom of the frame? It looks unusually strong for 24mm...almost looks more like a 16mm. Or did you skew the photo in post at all?
Thank you! It’s some of the guard rail and also from the pano at 24mm. It was freezing up there so I was lazy and made it quick lol
Ohhh I didn’t realize this was a pano. My bad. Makes more sense!
"Like, what is this structure for? Looking cool? I'm genuinely asking"
Tourist attraction I’m guessing. It’s right outside of the Hudson yards mall and I believe they are going to eventually sell tickets to get in.
Benny Hill style police chases. Duh
Instagram trap
I was totally convinced this was photoshop.
Google blew my mind :)
Awesome shot but congrats you don't own this photo.
"You win some, you lose some."
Not much of a loss tbh
Incredible!
Oh Damm!
Awesome symmetry
What were your expo settings like?
nice shot
but i think that structure is ugly and if I had a billion dollars and wanted a NY apartment I wouldnt buy one in Hudson Yards
"awesome, i'm going next week! also random question are there any bathrooms there near the top? asking because having to hold it all the way down must suck and i have the bladder of a grape"
