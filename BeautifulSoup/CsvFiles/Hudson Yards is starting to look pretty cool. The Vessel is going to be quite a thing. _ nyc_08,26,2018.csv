Still can't believe all of this is built on an elevated platform above a fucking train yard.
Incredible how it's being supported
Even the subways in general..... think about how much weight is sometimes above you. It's crazy.
I think about that often when I'm with OP's mom.
Think about the Holland Tunnel
Reminds me of OP’s mom.

Crazy how nature do that.

"Watch. Give it 15-25 years, The sunnyside yard will look like this. its a huge amount of land that will become very prized by developers."
Thing with sunny side is they just redid the catenary and decking it would require redoing almost all the overhead lines. Also the track layout there isn’t friendly for decking it over without impeding service. They probably will increase the density of surrounding areas first before ever deciding on decking it over.
""
They probably won't touch it for at least twenty years
Isn't sunnyside a little too close to Laguardia to have such tall buildings?
Not really. And that area already has plenty of tall buildings. This would just fill in a gaping space between two non-contiguous areas with tall buildings.
Good point I hadnt thought of that.  I just see it as a giant scar across queens. With LIC and NYC growing as it is I just figured the land would be built over. Nyc has a thing for decking over train yards. Park Ave and now Hudson yards are valuable as hell.
"When I was a graduate student, I worked on a project that would have ended up building an elevated platform above a rail yard in Shanghai. It's fairly amazing an idea as rail yards tend to use up a large amount of space and rarely have tall buildings. Plus, land can't really be created easily so its cheaper to build above!"

You can see it almost up to the 170s if youre on amsterdam.
"Dunno if I’m the only one, but the observation deck building totally reminds me of Stark tower."
"So weird how it's only on one side of the building, instead of all four sides.  I guess they assume nobody wants to look at NJ from that height."
"Is that what that is?  An observation deck?  My husband and I can see it from our apartment about 30 blocks uptown and have been arguing about it ever since it appeared.  He thought it was a weird crane in front of the building so that it looked like part of it.  I just think it is a building that is supposed to look like a giant chicken for whatever reason.  It sure is craptastic, no matter what it is."
New York needs just one chicken-like building. Just because.

Hudson Yards looks like models that haven't finished loading yet.
"I like how the Empire State Building is peeking out in the background like, ""remember me?"""
Hudson yards is going to be awesome. One Vanderbilt next to grand central is going up quickly. The new towers by Central Park will look great and hopefully balance out the skyline with that piece of shit 432 Park. And another super tall will be going up in downtown Brooklyn that will look great.
I'm anyways here for 432 Park hate

Nice.
It is amazing how generic they all look considering the number of top architects involved in some of the buildings. I assume cost constraints have limited ambition. The most interesting one (but that's relative) looks to be the Bjark Ingels spiral.

Indeed.
Yep.
"Counterpoint: Hudson Yards looks like a completely generic bunch of nearly identical sterile towers. The staircase is an eyesore, the shed is completely unnecessary, and it will probably be the most boring neighborhood in the history of New York City."
i imagine it will be like the docklands in london
"Totally. I think the big gain here is just that there is a ton of boring housing that will be available right in time to absorb all the wealthy people who were panicking about the L train to move into. It’s not an attractive or interesting neighborhood by any means, more of a necessary evil."
"Arguably won't this make it interesting. If you this diaspora of rich people fleeing the L train fiasco, sure it may not be the most fascinating neighborhood, but that will certainly attract a fair amount of food, culture, entertainment in the area. I can't see it being terrible for too long."
Bingo.  A soulless working environment.  Everyone leaves there to go do social stuff.

True New Yawker here. Took the 'g' off of 'fucking.' Go Yankees.
"It’s kind of a weird thing, and maybe an indication toward a trend. Maybe this is what’s to come—not unique and individual skyscrapers, themed clusters."
"I’m not that into them, either, but that’s the story of change. All kinds of NY institutions were frowned upon by both critics and the public at first. Patience and Fortitude, for instance (the lions in front of the NYPL main branch) were generally hated at the beginning."
"But once again, I don’t really like them. There’s this kind of slimy, corporate sheen they seem to give off"
"I agree, but I also think that one day we will look back fondly. A lot of the current iterations of glass buldings(like 432 park) will probably one day be torn down for larger better buildings, but I do think clustered areas like the WTC complex and Hudson yards will largely remain. I mean at the time, imagine how outrageous the empire state building and chrystler building, flatiron were. They were probably regarded as eyesores invading the serenity of the neighborhood, bringing too much business and hustle and bustle."
"But now those are some of the most well regarded buildings in NY. now I don't think hudson yards will ever get that reputation, but I could see hudson yards become a neighborhood of glass and being famous for that style for a long while as new architectural style comes into play. Part of the reason I think it will happen is that it is literally a new neighborhood, with no history, built out of thin air. Some say that makes it bland, I say that creates an impressive cultural opportunity. An entire neighborhood shaped by the new young manhattan wealth and their ideals of the early 21st century. Sounds pretty fascinating honestly. I mean, it may take a couple decades for it to come into it's own, but that's true of any neighborhood."
I kinda feel the same way about WTC if it wasn't for the transit hub.
At least The Spiral looks somewhat distinct. Has a sort of Ziggurat/Babylonian vibe.
Too bad it's still just a millionaires/billionairs pied-a-terre playground fling.
"It’s distinct, but you give that money to any artist or architect and they’ll give you something distinct. To me it just embodies futility. You’re climbing up this staircase to get a totally lame view of a place with no history and then climbing back down."
no history
"That's a little unfair, every neighbourhood starts with no history."
"If you're starting with a history, didn't you actually start earlier? 🤔🤔🤔"
You’re climbing up this staircase to get a totally lame view of a place with no history and then climbing back down.
"That's a good way of putting it, especially because I'm not a fan of the Vessel but could never really articulate why. It's all constructed: the vista itself, like it always is, but even the view is essentially the illusion of a neighborhood."
At least you get a good look at Weehawken though.
"I personally like the vessel, but even if one doesn't at least it isn't a focalpoint of NYC.  I hate 432 Park.  It's just a hideous box that that has undeserving prominance in the skyline.  Add something interesting architecturally at least!!"
"God do i hate 432 Park,"
"When it was being built i thought to myself ""It better not be a big stick, theres gotta be some cool design at the top"""

"Exactly. I just kept seeing it going higher and higher with no tiering or any kind of deviation in angles. I was hoping they would top it off with some kind of architectural spire or something, but no. It's the most pedestrian skyscraper I've seen in the city."
The view you get is the Hudson River and New Jersey...
I mean all of New York is a millionaires/billionaires playground...
"""Damn, the richest city in the US is pretty awesome, I just wish there weren't so many rich people."""
"This is a new development though. New York has been around for nearly 400 years, and it wasn’t until the last 20 or so where people would genuinely tell you that living there was some sort of luxurious privilege. It’s more that crime went down and now rich people are claiming it and trying to “disrupt” things that everyone else has just accepted for literally hundreds of years -beginning with inconvenient housing."

They are not nearly identical at all you are tripping
Your schtick stinks.  What would you prefer the buildings to look like?  Everyone’s a critic.
Or a metacritic.
"Also, one of the most fucking unwalkable neighborhoods of the city."
Yeah it was super walkable before.
"Ehhh, this will change once they get everything finished. It's unwalkeable know because of all the construction blocking paths, how dirty the street is and how bare the side streets are. Once they finish things the surrouding area will get cleaned up and fill up with storefronts and small businesses."
"In general I prefer older architecture like they chrysler, empire state, and ge building.  But for new buildings it looks pretty good but yeah, I'm not a huge fan of all glass buildings.  Something like the shard in london is pretty cool looking."

The vessel is FREE to the public to climb on
I would assume so.  Who’s going to pay money to climb a bunch of stairs?
You just said it’s not creating play space but it is creating a monumental free landmark that people can climb?
Look at my examples of play space.  Ball fields. Ice rinks.  Basketball courts. This is what kids need.  An art installation that doubles as a staircase is not “play space” for kids.  It’s a place for tourists and couples with no kids to walk with coffee. It’s the High Line.
The people who will actually be living in Hudson Yards will be loaded. Their kids won't be held back in life because they don't have a baseball field in their backyard. It's also friggin' Midtown.
"There are a lot of people living in Midtown west  who are not “loaded” and whose kids would benefit from nearby play space.  Manhattan as a whole would benefit from more places for kids to play soccer, baseball, hockey, basketball, and tennis.  People commute all over the city to access fields, rinks, and courts that their kids can play on, because all are in short supply and high demand.  I’m thankful that when Battery Park City was developed, someone had the pluck to demand that the development include a wonderful set of soccer/baseball fields right off the West Side Highway. (I’m sure others argued against it because “it’s friggin’ downtown.). But these are things that you’ll probably never understand if you’re not raising a family in the city."
"You can rest assured, your view is the one that carries the day with developers and the city.  Hudson Yards is being developed for people who are “loaded.”  And it’s “friggin’ Midtown,” so, I repeat, children of New York City, fuck you."
"No need to be so frosty. Related is paying billions to develop that area and, all things considered, I think it will be a boon for the city. A new tourist destination, first-rate office space, all of this will yield income the city needs. They also have set aside acres of green space which others will use, but you denounce because it's not kid-friendly. There's a lot of trade-offs living in the city; I can't feel too badly because you wanted ball fields and an ice hockey rink on 34th and 10th St."
Thanks for confirming you aren’t raising a family in the city.  It takes a special kind of scumbag to type “kid friendly” as if that phrase denotes some kind of special interest group.
You’re correct. It is lame
"That stairwell is absolutely disgusting. I feel the same way about the oculus with those awful spikes. I don't understand who likes these absurd abstract designs in modern architecture. Tear down gorgeous buildings like Penn Station (I know, it's not the same people) and build these atrocities, what the fuck New York?"
"the shed is completely unnecessary,"
"My guess is it will wind up only being moved once or twice a year, as it will be a PITA to maintain and operate."
Stop building shaming.

Delta City is coming along nicely.
Every fucking time man. And it’s gonna get worse too. Remember these are just the buildings. The “neighborhood” has yet to materialize.
Ever been to the Financial District after 7pm on a weekday? I used to live there. It is almost completely dead save for a couple of bars. Hudson Yards will probably be even more dead.
"Why ? The high line is packed on the weekends for starters, at least during nice weather"
Yup. I work at the yards on the weekend and it’s dead over there. Relateds idea this will be the new midtown will never come to fruition
Also they are building a huge retail base
Are there even any bars in that area?  I really can't think of anything within 5 blocks either way.
People RAVE about the area around Stone Street but it sucks. The south street seaport is kind of a unique area for NYC but it also kinda sucks.
"Also, the grocery options around there are weak as hell. Living there sucks. If you don't want to go to Fulton Market (a Key Foods store) you have to walk 20+ mins to the Whole Foods in Tribeca loooool. Every other grocery store there, by that I mean all 3 of them, are overpriced as fuck and the produce is usually old as hell too. Dead neighborhood."
"Was referring to Hudson Yards.  Never had any affinity for living way downtown post- Sandy, when the power was out for a while."
"Yeah, Sandy really fucked that place up"
Not really.
The issue with the financial district is that it is single use commercial. The Hudson yards is mixed use
Could you elaborate?
It’s boring AF.
It's not finished yet
"The architecture. It doesn’t feel like it fits in NYC. It’s so artless and corporate looking, it could be in any city in any country."
"But what is NYC's look? It's not really defined. Throughout its existence the towers that went up were a testament to the popular architectural trends of the time, not to any one look."
"Yes, there are a lot of Art deco buildings in the city but that's largely because that style came into prominence during the first skyscraper boom in the city."
"We are, or at least were, in the midst of another skyscraper boom. This one just happens to be defined by today's architectural stylings."
"To push back -- I think the greater prevalence of pre-war buildings on the east side, in financial district, and still in most of midtown preserves a lot of the original ""NYC"" character. Even the ""international style"" buildings of 6th avenue have a unique 60/70s character. These new glassy towers all lack that character, IMO, with their smooth lines and thinner silhouettes."

I care less about density of buildings than that that looks like Houston.
"All these new buildings and no infrastructure to support them. No new police/fire/EMS stations, or any other public services for people who will be living/working there. It’s like whoever planned this never played SIM City at all!"
They opened a whole new subway station to support it. A big station too
My opinion? Im glad they're building more housing.
that no one can afford  to live in.
"Lets say those apartments immediately fill with people who are insanely rich. Then thats that much rich people demand that that building just soaked up, instead of them buying a brownstone next to you, raising your rent tremendously."
"And surrounding buildings have to make their rents more competitive too, now that more people have more options. This does ultimately lower rents, these markets of expensive and cheap housing arent isolated from each other."
""
"If you dump 1000000 katrillion pounds of gold, in the form of large baseball sized hunks of gold, on the market, it affects the market for all gold, even tiny gold coins."

"If you flood the timber market with wood, if you flood the banana market with bananas, any market. It doesnt matter if theres a luxury wood market and a luxury banana market, and a cheap wood and cheap banana market, these things effect each other. if the price of luxury bananas comes down, thats good for all consumers. and makes the cheap banana business people have to make their own products and prices more appealing if they want to stay competitive."
In a true capitalist market. That's not what we have here. RE in NYC is full of money laundered crap that no one lives in. Prices are artificially inflated.

There is an elevator in the vessel
"The Vessel is ADA compliant, there is an elevator that stops at every single level of the structure. Public spaces like that are required to be handicapped accessible."
I saw it on my way home from school. These funds should be focused on a moving platform straight from court square to Laguardia. This would please me greatly.
