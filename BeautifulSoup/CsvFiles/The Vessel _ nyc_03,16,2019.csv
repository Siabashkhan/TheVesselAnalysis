"""Every architect in the world, including me, only builds penises. Giant sky penises. Just once, I'd like to build a giant vagina."""
"--the architect, probably"
Truly inspirational.
But like...a honeycomb vagina.
‚Äî the architect after a few drinks
Just makes me like this more.
That's a crazy looking elevator!
Pretty sure they wouldn't be allowed to build it without it being accessible.
‚ÄúArt‚Äù? ‚ÄúEnjoy‚Äù??
Some people are able to lighten up and enjoy things that other people don‚Äôt.
With the responses in this thread you‚Äôd think this statue was paid for by selling off the Met or something.
This statue was paid for by massive tax break and subsidy by the city.
If you threw a rock in Manhattan you‚Äôd hit something paid for by tax breaks and subsidies. At least this time we‚Äôre getting public art out of it.
"Look, you won‚Äôt hear me complaining about The Shed, which is architecturally ingenious and provides valuable cultural programming. The Vessel, however, is vacuous Instagram bait designer to attract tourists to malls. It is specifically designed to tire people out and send them running to buy the next coffee, juice, or beer at the fucking mall."
You basically described NYC.
And presumably youd describe the Eiffel tower the same way?
""
"I think theyd gladly have put another building in place fo the vessel, but simply assumed that the public would never go for it and wanted it to be more spread out with different novelties between the buildings."
"Meh. Probably a drop in the bucket compared to the rest of the expenses. Also this kind of architecture is what makes people excited about nyc. It's good for culture, brings money into the city, creates jobs etc etc."
Hudson Yards got a bigger tax break than Amazon was gonna get.
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/nyregion/hudson-yards-new-york-tax-breaks.html
How dare you bring facts into this discussion /s
Like he said. It's a drop in the bucket.
"If you think this is what makes people excited about NYC, you are sorely mistaken."
This is a piece of soulless corporate art - and I am using this term loosely - that communicates nothing and appeals to no one other than Instagram idiots.
"Well okay what would you rather, another soulless corporate office building?"
This at least provides something new and interesting.
"That seems like a false dichotomy - soulless corporate office building or soulless corporate art, no other alternatives."
"Just to be clear, would you have preferred that another building be built in its place? I think, had the creators of HY been aware that that is what the public preferred, they would've gladly done that. They just assumed that people wanted space and some things in between the new large buildings."
Every new building in the city gets some sort of tax break
Don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre being downvoted so heavily. I chuckled a little
No idea.
"I was simply pointing out there is absolutely no place to stop and enjoy in this structure. It is designed to get people in and out as quickly as possible, so they can get back to shopping."
I just saw it and before I found it I was saying those stares are going to be a killer for my knee! lol
Lol sorry im on my cell
"To be fair, staring at your knees for too long may also be painful."
"I do not understand the hate this is getting already. I think its architecturally very interesting, and great that it is open to the public. I guess people like to complain about new things."
History is filled with detractors.
"PARIS ‚Äî Just over 100 years ago, the leading writers, artists and intellectuals of France banded together to denounce the impending construction of what they called ""the useless and monstrous"" Eiffel Tower. Their petition made them one of French history's laughingstocks."
http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-23/news/mn-722_1_eiffel-tower
At least the Eiffel Tower has an amazing view of Paris.  The Vessel has a slightly different view of the same immediate buildings that you see on the ground.
It has a great view of the stores and restaurants! /s
The Eiffel Tower was the first modern structure to be built taller than the pyramids.  So in that respect it was more of an engineering feat than just a piece of architecture.
People on this subreddit will literally complain about anything.
My favorite complaint on this sub is people getting pissed that not many NYC voters voted for Cynthia Nixon as if she had a chance to win the state vote.
Why didn‚Äôt people vote for the person I wanted them to vote for?!
It's the Vessel's fault.
Hard body
"Thanks, Vessel!"
My favorite complaint is how much everyone hates Cuomo but yet everyone keeps re electing him.
"So, according to you, I have no right to dislike this building?"
"I dislike this building. It's creepy. There are far too many opportunities for committing suicide. It wastes an enormous amount of space. The colors are dull. How many balconies does a building need? If I spit off this balcony, I wonder how long it will take to hit those people down there? It strikes me as an architect's show-off building that the rest of us will have to put up with for decades. I don't like this building."
...then don't go there?
"No one is saying to don't have the right to dislike the building, or to express that opinion. That doesn't mean others have to agree with you or respect that opinion if they think it's dumb."
"Do you live in Hudson Yards? If not, then this building has exactly zero impact on your life. Personally I think it's pretty dumb when people waste so much time and energy expressing intense dislike for something that doesn't affect them at all."
Maybe it wastes space but youd probably be even more annoyed if they put another huge building there. Most people who are anti hudson yards just seem to be anti development and sort of protectionist of the established real estate players.
Holy crap dude.
That‚Äôs one major leap to the snowy peaks of Snowflake City.
Imagine getting upset about that thing
Building don't kill people‚Äîpeople kill people. Hate gravity while you're at it.
"Or say that only transplants like it. Among the things ""only transplants like"" I've heard dollar slices, keeping right on escalators, bodegas, and iced coffee."
If I had to generalize about Real New Yorkers I'd have to say most of them don't care about what some nerd on reddit thinks and like whatever the hell they want to like.
Everything but iced coffee is me ü§î
"I don't get it are those things supposed to be transplant things, cuz being cheap, being efficient, growing up eating trash from your local bodega or one near your school all seem New Yorker things"
"My grandma‚Äôs a Real New Yorker and I‚Äôm a transplant (with a generation raised in New Jersey in between... shudder), and I feel like we could both appreciate all of those things."
I see what you did there
""
Are you kvetching about my right to kvetch? /s
"Same on trip advisor, Amazon reviews and youtube. You can watch the most informative, accurate, altruistic video, and sure enough it will have a fair number of downvotes."
"People like that actually fuck up the usefullness of reviews. ""It was one day late"" therefore it gets one star."
I worked at 10 Hudson Yards (literally next to this) and watched it being built from start to finish and think it‚Äôs one of the stupidest things I‚Äôve ever seen in my life. But thats just one persons opinion. Had the placement been better I could potentially appreciate it more but the best view is of the actual structure and not what you can see from it
...I appreciate the free mousepad we got of ‚Äúthe vessel rising‚Äù
""
"Saw the same pushback in Chicago when the bean was built, which is now relatively iconic. Proposals, weddings, etc. No one can predict the long term reception but I think it‚Äôll be positive, on average I‚Äôve found people esp tourists love interactive architecture"
"Dude, people HATED Patience and Fortitude (the NYPL lions) when they were first built. This will easily become an iconic piece of the city"
I am starting to think Hudson Yards' PR company is paying people to post positive comments about this monstrosity. Or are people this stupid on all their own?
lol
I don‚Äôt understand the hate either. It‚Äôs just not that interesting.
Florence has David. And a Duomo. We have  stairs.
If you're a critic at the NYT that's literally how you get paid. By bitching about the accomplishments of other people.
Sounds like someone doesn't understand how criticism works
it‚Äôs throwing money down the fucking toilet. even if it‚Äôs private money
"Stop and consider where this money is going: workers and materials. It's taking money out of private hands and feeding it back into the economy. It's very FDR of them, and NYC loves FDR."
"What's really funny is that a lot of the construction workers on site bitched about what a waste it is. ""It's a whole bunch of stairs going nowhere!"""
I personally don't give a damn.
And the High Line is a railway going nowhere...
"money goes to workers and materials whether u build a commercial structure, a residential building, or a fucking staircase. the former 2 actually generating revenue after they‚Äôre completed. don‚Äôt get me wrong i love structures that provide great views for tourists but in this case you‚Äôre providing views of buildings and a train yard."
I guess OP would prefer it go toward stock buy-backs and military hardware.
Most people who are anti hudson yards are anti development. But would you have preferred they build a building in that space instead?
""
"if they knew that most of society wouldve been ok with it, it probably wouldve been part of their proposal. I'l bet they assumed that they needed to keep it spread out otherwise the community would never go for it."
Land of the Free.
I would love to run up and down those stairs.
"So, you actually need tickets to enter. It was opening weekend and the people working it were giving out store sponsored comp tickets. Not sure the price going forward. After having been up and down, I wouldn‚Äôt pay more than $5 to do it."
All tickets are free and I believe it's only for crowd control at this point.
Yeah is basically crowd control
tried to get tickets... waited in a virtual line... nothing available til December 2020
Maybe someone took all the reservations and is going to be scalping tickets lol.
"I got tickets online for same day yesterday at 830am, fwiw."
Where do you get into the virtual line? Thank you!
I bet you uni frat rushes will be hazed with these stairs. So much potential!
Yes the wild party frats of NYU and Columbia...
""
UNSUBSCRIBED
looks trippy af
"It's not trippy on the way up and on the way down, it better not be."
I want the trippiest and gnarliest fight scene for the next next John Wick movie to happen here.
"I'll be honest. I think it's pretty cool, and I can't wait to go there when I get back to New York."
So glad we‚Äôre able to provide things on our 20 square miles that you‚Äôll enjoy on your occasional visit. Please let us know f the Olive Garden in Times Square is still meeting your needs.
"You sound like someone who‚Äôs trying too hard to sound like they‚Äôre from New York, but really they live and go to high school in Secaucus."

I live in New York. I'm not there because I'm studying abroad for the year (last August until this June). I miss it dearly
:D Lmao
"Wish it had any sort of greenery, but it still looks pretty cool."
""
How long before they decide to connect it to those stores?
The same people who are bitching about it would be complaining there was nothing artistic about HY without it.
Damned if you do.  Damned if you don‚Äôt.
I look forward to checking out all of HY in a month or two once the buzz dies down and it warms up.
Vessel and The Shed are both supremely cool imo.  At least in theory/design/functionality.  Gotta go and confirm but I don‚Äôt see what all the hate is about.
Hudson Yards is an isolated community that everyone can avoid if they want.  It isn‚Äôt like Times Square that you will inevitably find yourself in at some point no matter how hard u try to avoid it.
I‚Äôm super excited about the shed! I scored tickets for Bjork and I think it‚Äôs going to be incredible!
Woww well done!  They did a great job scoring her to really break it in.  It'd be amazing either way but if it really is her most elaborate performance then it's gonna be fantastic
"Am I the only one who really doesn't give a shit about this? It's just a fucking sculpture in the middle of a brand new neighborhood. Most people are not going to HY regularly if at all, so why is everyone here getting their panties twisted over a bunch of stairs. It's not like it's hurting anyone lol. I'll probably just go check out to see if it's as ""terrible"" as reddit apparently says it is, but I don't think it's really worth all this stress lol"
Being pressed about everything is a timeless New York tradition.
"yea but let's be honest, most NYers ain't pressed about this shit, we pressed about rent, our job, real shit. It's a bunch of fucking nobodies freaking out over nothing cuz they got no other worries."
It‚Äôs ok to stop and smell the roses sometime. Coming from another rat race city - Toronto.
For someone saying it‚Äôs not worth the stress you‚Äôre pretty stressed yourself.
"Yet, here you are, partaking. You should have just continued to scroll down."
"because the money could have been used in countless other ways, toward the MTA for example. but instead we got a $25b glorified mall and ~$200m toward some pseudo-public art space"
"This wasn't taxpayer money, so you could make the same argument for literally everything."
"C'mon now, don't knock these suicide machines just because society is in disarray."
"Tbf, even they did use it on the subway, they would squander it on ""beautification"" projects instead of using it on fixing the broken signal system, or the rampant homeless problem plagueing the subways."
""
It's crazy that about 2 years ago I saw pieces of this building being delivered via barge while i was working in port newark thinking what the hell is that thing for? Now i work right across the hudson from the building and it all makes sense.
Can someone explain the ticket system to me? I know its free but do u have to go to there and wait on a line for a ticket? Do they sell out?
Wondering myself
"The tickets are for crowd control, otherwise there would be thousands of people trying to climb it at once."
Now I see what the architect was getting at with the Indian stepwell inspiration. It‚Äôs beautiful from the inside but from the outside it looks like a dumpy pine cone.
I probably won‚Äôt go because I hate hordes of Instagram hungry tourists.
hordes
Oops thanks ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Watching too much Hoarders I guess
I probably won‚Äôt go because I don‚Äôt have any friends to go with and I hate people
FTFY
"You're weirdly defensive about this pine cone, chill."
It is pretty dope to be honest. Did it yesterday and had a bit of fun.
Same. I‚Äôm not a fan of the Hudson Yards buildings in general but the Vessel is pretty cool. Went up yesterday and it‚Äôs a really interesting piece of architecture and a decent glute workout. :)
"I see some exercise potential here. Spiral up and then down at whatever speed is suitable for you, occasionally stop on the platforms to do some other exercises like a few squats or some lunges."
Neat.
Lol!
Wait... ü§î this is low-key genius
It's kafkaesque. Like the neighborhood it's in.
""
The Metamorphosis is really Kafkaesque...
"Basically, Franz Kafka wrote some books, most famously the metamorphosis and the trial. People typically associate Kafka with oppressive and/or nightmarish qualities, illogical etc. Think of it like a really bad dream. This is the most common, laymen association of the word."
Which really means nothing in that one's perception of this may or may not be Kafkaesque lol.
"Honestly, I'm a bit confused what is Kafkaesque about this. I suppose if you're a hardcore socialist, a ""capitalist monument"" like the Hudson Yards complex and the vessel would be nightmarish. But then again, it's not like a bunch of glass buildings and a weird structure are that unique in the abstract. So I guess, I don't really understand what is kafkaesque here, but whatever lol"
""
"In terms of architecture, it means ""look how smart I am""."
Who's Kafka?!?!
Tell me!!!
Prague‚Äôs Kafka Airport rated worst in recent survey
Haha. The clock behind that first traveler interviewed.
This is pure Kafka.
so awesome.
That‚Äôs bad ass
"I like it and thanks OP for the pic,  yours will be the first of many. I could do without the mall though."
"It looks like it could be some Covenant base structure in one of the old Halo games, which is cool to me."
"A couple months back I went on a sailboat leaving from Chelsea Piers, and looked at that building and the rest of Hudson Yards as it was coming together. It looked really spectacular."
"I‚Äôm glad they finally built something there. Trump wanted to build Television City there. Then stadiums for the Giants or Jets, or the Olympics ..."
"It looks so good, but what's its purpose?"
"Aesthetic enrichment, I suppose, and potentially exercise."
Whats the purpose of the Eiffel Tower?
"That‚Äôs the tallest ‚Äúbuilding‚Äù in the whole city of Paris, so the views are first-rate. Whereas here you get a view of the side of a super tall building.  Eiffel Tower also has a broadcasting function."
Looks like something from 1984 or Brazil (the film).
Interesting but I get a creepy authoritarian vibe from it. Definitely not boring.
Well NYC loves going down the authoritarian route sooo....
Are you supposed to zig zag your way up or spiral around?
""
"It is designed to attract shoppers to the nearby boutiques, so yeah."
Seems stupid and pointless.
"Great views of Lululemon and Sephora, though."
"Agreed, just like that stupid Statue of Liberty."
The statue of liberty was given to us from France to symbolize our allegiance. It was the first thing of America to millions of people searching for a fresh start and opportunity to get out of the oppression they faced. This is a 200 million dollar sculpture built in the middle of 20 billion dollars of high rises that will be the super rich playground. These are not the same.
No
r/Woooosh
No
"False: the Staten Island Ferry, The Brooklyn Bridge, the NYC Panorama at the Queens Museum, The Unisphere!, Central Park, the West Side Greenway,  the Little Red Lighthouse, Governors Island, etc. NYC is chock full of awesome tourist attractions."
No.
Parisians originally hated the Eiffel Tower too.
This would have been much better as an elevated park.
Agreed. Would‚Äôve been extra nice to have more greenery in the cityscape as well.
Hudson Yards has its own very long and famous elevated park already...
They didn't even put trees or solar panels on it.
"As someone who worked on the preliminary construction of this thing, yes it is extremely stupid and extremely pointless but at least it's privately funded. You should see some of the useless shit that the Parks Department installs."
It's not privately funded. More than $4B was given to the Hudson Yards project.
The sculpture itself is paid for by Stephen Ross.
But the project was given hundreds of millions in taxes.
That includes things like the 7 train extension though.  Spending public money isn't always bad.
$450M was given as tax breaks.
It‚Äôs like a human hamster wheel.
"I‚Äôm curious, is there anything to keep people from jumping off?  Human nature can be inexplicable - it seems like this is set up to be an attractive nuisance if one or two down on their luck and mentally unstable people get the idea to go out very publically at a playground for the rich."
"I keep seeing these suicide suggestions every time this thing is mentioned here and it baffles me. If someone wants to kill themselves, they‚Äôre going to find a way to do it, and there‚Äôs no reason to potentially ruin the enjoyment/beauty of something for everyone else because of the fear that someone might purposefully hurt themselves using it. There are lots of high places to kill yourself in NYC. You could very easily jump the barriers on the top of 30 Rock and ensure instant death instead of jumping off this thing and risk only permanently maiming yourself and surviving. This thing is not more of a risk than 100‚Äôs of other places."
I keep seeing these suicide suggestions every time this thing is mentioned here and it baffles me.
"You and me both. Literally every fucking post about this, without fail, has somebody bringing up suicide. I don't understand what people think they're contributing by bringing it up. Do they think it's really insightful to point out that people can jump off of high structures?"
Virtue signalling.
"You obviously aren't a native new yorker or you wouldn't be baffled by this. Suicide barriers have been a thing for a while now, it was ramped up after people im NYU kept jumping off the middle of the library."
"Yeah, in some places, but most places don't have them. It's cheaper and more attractive to just let things be and let the others win their Darwin awards. As for Bobst, the barriers actually look artistic."
Idk man. I'd prefer not having people jumping to their deaths in front of me.
"Well, what can you do, short of suing their estates for reckless endangerment?"
At least you‚Äôre honest that your desire for suicide barriers is based on the fact that you don‚Äôt want to be inconvenienced. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you do just don‚Äôt do it somewhere it will effect me!‚Äù
Or children and innocent bystanders. I was merely putting it in a light manner.
Cute you couldn't figure that out for yourself though. You're so selfless
Nothing really. What you see is what it is.
The suicide thing is the most idiotic talking point I‚Äôve seen about this. How many people are just out there looking for fun new things to themselves to chuck themselves off of? Your lack of human interaction is glaring.
There is nothing keeping people from jumping off 90% of the buildings in the city.
This looks like a rendering
They warned us that this was going to be Instagram Heaven and they were right.

"If you showed me this photograph 20 years ago, I'd say: 'ahah! So the libraries of the future don't need books!'."
Looks kinda like Raccoon City from the RE movie.
Is this free to visit?
"It's about how today's people with access to capital AND the entire recorded history of art nonetheless can't tell the difference between taxpayer-funded grift and actual public sculpture, because we've roided them up with Rand-ian politics, suburban life experience and no discernable values"
Holy hell it looks so industrial! Nothing but artificial structure.
I wanna clime it all.
"I've got lots of problems with this entire Hudson Yards shopping mall business, but this stairs thing specifically? I'm okay with this."
"I love this. Plus, looks like good exercise going up and down the stairs."
Use the people and landings for scale and evaluate for yourself.
""
"What are they going to do about preventing potential suicides from the top?  Those guardrails don't look too high.  Not saying it would be easy to add such preventative measures without ruining the aesthetics of the design, but I would hate to see this become a suicide destination (like the Golden Gate Bridge)."
Will probably be a popular suicide location.
Nike / Adidas commerical there is pretty much guaranteed.
Park in Jersey and get the PATH to 33rd.
"I‚Äôm just gonna say it - How long until someone falls from one of the top floors, either on purpose or accidentally?  And then how long after that until it‚Äôs permanently closed?"
"My building is 35 stories, across the st from the world trade center, and no barrier to prevent suicide jumping. No one has jumped in the 10~ years ive lived here."
"So how long? Probably quite a while. They could just as easily jump off a bridge, or a number of other spots."
It's a (fake)  maze.
I agree with the redditor who named Escher as source of inspiration.
""
Where is this place?
Hudson Yards.
"ah yes, a new type of nightmare hellmaze for New York City. gotta catch 'em all!"
Perfect place for Pok√©mon Go indeed!
wait what? hudson yards?
Jeez it looks even more stupid inside. I dont understand the point of going up all those stairs.
"Physical exercise is good‚ÄîNYC even has skyscraper stairwell runs for charity, like the ones at 4WTC."
I saw it in the recent Judge Dredd! The movie sucked.
Made a 4K video inside the Vessel showing you what it is like to walk from the bottom all the way up to the top. Enjoy!
