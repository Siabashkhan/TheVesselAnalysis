Is it open again or are people still killing themselves off it?
"It's the perfect place to commit suicide. It provides easy access to a long fall, and a depressing ugliness that makes you want to kill yourself."
Jesus. This is why we can't have nice things.
People commit suicide there?
"Yeah, they closed it off after third one."
Paid for with money meant for low income families.
Anyone have a flamethrower I can borrow? Asking for a friend.
"Yeah, the funding for that complex is bullshit. I believe I read somewhere around a billion dollars meant for Harlem/Upper Manhattan went to Hudson Yards, instead."
Me and some buddies have been wanting to egg  it for a while now. Coalition?
This is visually overwhelming. It's a nightmare if anything. Probably seemed like a good idea on paper. But hey that's just my opinion.
The whole point is to have art thar drives interaction from the people inside it.
"It didn't look good on paper when it was proposed, and it looks even worse in real life."
It kinda sucks irl
"It looks pretty, but all that wasted space pisses me off."
It's essentially an interactive sculpture. Do you consider all public art to be wasted space?
When it’s bad art
"Define ""bad art."""
"Art that occupies or disturbs space better utilized in productive or constructive ways instead of intellectual/visual stimulation? (As in the money, effort, and resources could have materially, directly benefited people - not an abstract thing like a 'city' or 'neighborhood')"
"Also, most art tbh. Few works break from ""just a ____"" by ______ in the public zeitgeist sort of way."
Honest try lol
You would have been one of those guys who complained about the effect tower
"eiffel, damn"
"It isn't a building, it's a walkway"
"So would central park, which is why they don't."
"This is a CGI, right? Why not use an actual photo?"
And this image makes it appear much nicer than it actually looks in real life.
but whyyyyyyyyyyy? It’s just waste of space on waste of space on top of more waste of space.
It is a park/public art instalation
"The main failure of the Vessel for me is it’s lack of context awareness. The thing doesn’t say anything about New York, this area of Manhattan or anything tri-state or even east coast related. It’s just a cool, nifty looking object. It could fit just as well (or as badly) in Dubai or Shanghai. It really has no soul tying it to anything, except suicide."
"Hudson Yards, in a nutshell"
I remember when Project Runway used these death stairs as a runway. That was wild. I had anxiety not wanting anyone to biff in heels.
Are those stairs there just for the sake of having stairs? It needs slides too - like a giant 'snakes and ladders'.
Suicide vessel. I read an article that was talking about tearing it down.
We can only hope. That thing is lame.
It cost $200 million. They are not tearing it down. People jump off bridges too.
More than 25 from the Brooklyn Bridge; no one is talking about shutting that down.
"Yes I know how it much it costs, the article talked about the costs of building it vs the costs of tearing it down. I never claimed anything other than reading an article about exploring the idea of tearing it down not that they were going to do so."
just damn
They gotz un elebater 2
"That's quite something, where is it located?"
Nyc. Hudson yards
Thanks.
Not very disable friendly.
Actually it is. It has an elevator that travels on a curved path and stops on each level.
The suicide vessel as it’s becoming now...
This Is Not A Place of Honor.
Please downvote the vessel everytime it's posted on reddit thank you
I loved visiting there. It was such a cool experience. Sad it’s closed.
This architecture is so satisfying to my eyes
Try navigating that with a mobility aid.
"I like the way the Vessel looks, it is aesthetically pleasing to me. Sorry that some people have used it to take their lives though."
