"I'm an electrician in NYC, and I actually helped build The Vessel when it was going up among other projects at Hudson Yards."
"As morbid as it sounds, when our crew was working on The Vessel we all made predictions on when the first suicide was going to happen. Some people said it'd be a few months, one guy even said within the first week of it opening. I said it'd be within a year of opening day."
There really isn't much protection to stop someone from climbing over the glass partitions on the top of The Vessel and jumping. I guess the builder didn't think of that.
"It’s art, keep it clean looking rather then safe I’d say."
"If someone wants to kill themselves, a better fence will only make them look elsewhere."
"Imagine visiting the Vessel with family and friends. You're having a good time taking pictures and appreciating the sights. Then all of a sudden, someone jumps off the top and kills themselves. I can't imagine how horrified and uncomfortable all of the visitors felt. That's traumatizing for locals and tourists alike."
Terrible! But it someone made up their mind to do it...they are gonna do it. Never underestimate someone's will to do something good or bad
