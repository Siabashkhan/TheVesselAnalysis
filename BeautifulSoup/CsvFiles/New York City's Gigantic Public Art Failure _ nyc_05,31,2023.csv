"Designed to be the crown jewel of the Hudson Yards development, a 150-foot-tall collection of 154 interconnected staircases known as the Vessel remains off limits."
Sad I never got to go up before it shut down
"I went up once. Before I did I would walk past it thinking ""this looks cool but it's just stairs"", but walking up it was actually kind of cool. It's a lot taller than I expected it to be, walking up was almost a hike honestly."
"Also a lot of the surfaces are reflective, so it messes with your perception as you walk up. Kind of felt like being inside that tesseract thing at the end pf Interstellar."
"""it's just stairs"" was exactly what I thought..so I never got the chance. Did take a cool pic with a friend in front with no tourists in the early COVID days, so at least I have that"
This is how I expected to feel before I walked on it as well. I didn't mind the concept of 'stairs to nowhere' because many public monuments are essentially that (see:eiffel tower).. But I didn't expect to like it as much as I did when I was in it. I have some great night shots from inside of it that look very impressive with all of the mirrored surfaces
I went up once when there was enthusiasm around it. It was so crowded I felt I could easily be pushed off by someone staring at their phone. Almost gave me a panic attack. Whoever decided to make the glass railing so low is a fucking idiot. 0/10 would not recommend unless it's almost empty
They should add an elevator
It has one but I saw it and it moves really slow
"Hmmm, I wonder if it felt like a hike because it was literally just a set of stairs out in public."
"I meant hike figuratively. As in, it felt like I had walked a very long way, as if I had just gone on a hike."
Mostly just meant that my legs were more tired than expected when I got to the top.
I understand it is not literally a hike.
‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt literally walking in the woods! I got youuuu!‚Äù /s
"I was there once, someone tripped and fell and they closed part of it off for the EMTs to work. At least that is what I assumed .. maybe it was something worse."
"Did the fall down every stair all of the way to the bottom, like a Mel Brooks movie? Was it Mel Brooks?!?"
"A few people jumped, they added the glass railings but somehow that didn't work and they had to shut it down."
They even stopped people from going up it alone then some kid jumped off with his family there. That had to be horrific.
"I went around the time it was first opened they were giving tickets away for little to nothing. Steps were Very complicated, elevators were very slow and they blocked 1/2 off for ppl with disabilities (understandable because it was a long way up/down)"
I went up that first week it opened. Honestly the view from up there is nothing special. Haven't stepped foot in HY in years.
"I got a cool selfie with the camera looking up from the ground level, the experience was pretty cool. Not worth opening again because of the suicides though imo"
"You know what‚Äôs crazy, people can just go across the street and jump off the 3rd or 4th floor inside the mall for pretty much the same effect."
"Last time I was at HY a friend said something similar‚Äîwe were on the top floor looking out the windows at the Vessel and he looks down and says, ‚ÄúWhat do you need that for? Take a header right here!‚Äù"
Exactly. During the holidays it gets crazy busy so they‚Äôll still shock some overseas tourist and if they‚Äôre lucky maybe even land on one if the timings right.
Ok I‚Äôm off Reddit for the day.
That happened 2 years ago in Toronto too.
Means denial isn‚Äôt any solution.
Fully agree.
You cant escape reddit.
Those tiles have to be like $6 each and they are SOLID. It‚Äôll be sure to splatter your brain.
People would do that in the mall I used to work at in high school. And when I lived denver for a few years there was bridge that was about 20 feet above a stream that multiple people would commit suicide by hanging themselves off of. Some people called it hangman‚Äôs bridge because it happened often enough. If people want to kill themselves somewhere public‚Ä¶it‚Äôs going to happen
Cherry Creek?
"Mall was in NY, bridge was near the skatepark in Denver on platt river"
"Not because the art is bad, but because humans can't control themselves."
right. people jump off the Golden Gate bridge all the time - does that make the bridge a failure?
"GGB is art, yes, but it still has a utilitarian purpose."
The Vessel does not.
Making suicide easier is pretty utilitarian.
what a waste of a perfectly good taxpayer
"Eh, they probably weren't paying that much in taxes."
"Begs the question: If they charged admission, how much would the suicidal pay to jump? $10.00? $20.00?"
"According to historical records of New New York, suicide booths are a quarter."
Adjust for inflation please
$0.00001
Suicide is bad ass
The Vessel does not.
"The Vessel is a tourist sponge. It doesn't actually take up a lot of space, and you can fit hundreds of people on it."
...are the only public art installations worth having the one's with some utilitarian purpose?
"I think the point is that the bridge hasn't failed at being a bridge, but the Vessel has failed at being an experiential observation platform because people decided it can't function as that because of people."
Precisely.
"The GGB is an iconic piece of architectural art, but it also serves its utilitarian function as a piece of critical infrastructure."
"The Vessel was touted as the ""interactive centerpiece of Hudson Yards"" (their words) and was hyped up as an experiential project for people to enjoy, but it can't do that anymore."
So it is unfair to compare a major piece of artwork that has utility to a piece of artwork where you're not even allowed to climb the stairs because it utterly failed as an interactive centerpiece.
""
"Of course not, nor did my comment say or even imply this."
You literally invented an argument I never made and then replied to it.
Not everything has to be utilitarian.
I did not say or imply otherwise.
You are trying to issue a rebuttal to a point I never made.
Literally the only thing I wrote is that you can't really compare a piece of art with a clear utilitarian function with a piece of art that has none.
Helps me look around easier
Are you comparing a piece of interactive public art with a bridge? What was a bridge constructed for? And why was the Vessel constructed?
"In case you're new to the world, The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most photographed, painted and mythologized structures in the world. It may function as a bridge but it exists in our psyche as public art."
to answer this question:
Are you comparing a piece of interactive public art with a bridge?
yup
In case you‚Äôre new to the world
I am going to steal this and reuse it everywhere applicable from now on. What a passive aggressive badass.
ü§£
"He has a point though. If the Golden Gate Bridge served no purpose other than being art, yeah they'd probably consider closing it due to the rate of suicides."
"He wasn't asking if it had artistic merit, he was stating that it had a purpose beyond the aesthetic that makes it hard to shut down."
"My dude, you do realize it‚Äôs both. It IS both."
Architecture IS art. Someone designed that and it wasn‚Äôt a copy and paste one of a million kind of bridge. Art is anything involving creative design which exists in multiple mediums‚Ä¶.including architecture.
"Believe it or not, structures can be both. See: Brooklyn Bridge, Chrysler Building, Sydney Opera House, etc. etc."
"Anytime I see this specific OP post something in the sub, I just cringe and get ready for stupid logic from them in the replies"
"Not the idiot youre arguing, but its technically International Orange. Learned that at trivia night years ago and it lives rent free in my head, and hopefully yours now too."
"I mean, that article says the designers picked the color early in the process. That is a pretty normal time to pick colors during construction."
Also I guarantee you the architects and engineers thought of this as a piece of public art in addition to a bridge.
Is the vessel a piece of art constructed as art?
Or is it a bunch of staircases? Meant for people to climb and look over an area?
How do you post something like this but lack the ability to understand something like the Golden Gate Bridge can and is considered art?
How do this many people miss the incredibly obvious point that he's making?
The point he‚Äôs trying to make is that it was a waste of money and now is a ‚Äúuseless‚Äù structure. How are you missing the point that it‚Äôs not useless?
"No, his point is that the Vessel is art constructed as art, with no utilitarian purpose beyond the aesthetic, so comparisons of any kind to the Golden Gate Bridge, a key piece of infrastructure for an entire region, regarding the closures are fundamentally insane."
Thanks for saying exactly what I just said in more words. Appreciate ya.
You are getting cooked in the comments lol
"Imagine calling one of the most photographed, iconic, painted, recognizable structures in the entire world ""just a bridge."""
"Just because it has a function or even has one as its main purpose, doesn't mean it's not art."
"Otherwise, we would just call the Hive, ""stairs"""
Answers.
Yes.
To span a waterway.
For the likes.
They have nets now for that
Is that why they closed the Vessel? Were people jumping off it?
I thought it was just a victim of covid and was surprised it‚Äôs still closed.
Society gotta make suicide seem less appealing.
""
"Preventative measures should be pursued too. Nets under bridges, for example, reduce suicide rates across an entire region."
The UK saw a significant drop in suicides when they simply changed cooking gas and made it difficult to kill yourself that way.
We paid 200 million dollars to make suicide more accessible rather than spend 200 million dollars to ameliorate the suffering that can lead to suicidality directly. New York City baby
That isn't why it was built though.
My cousin Jay says it was built to receive radio transmissions from aliens in space. I have my doubts...
Imagine that.. wait we do not have to‚Ä¶
I‚Äôll take the vessel
"Imagine having the opportunity not to let everyone know you value inanimate structures over human life, and then saying 'fuck it' lmao"
"No, I don‚Äôt really care about every single persons mental health and I shouldn‚Äôt have to"
This kind of sociopathy used to be taboo. We are so fucked.
I think it‚Äôs sociopathic to want to remove public art installations because some people jumped off it which they can do with literally any other readily accessible point of elevation in the city
"I didn't suggest it be removed. If you want to make up arguments you can do it alone in the shower. I do suggest that we stop investing millions in these types of useless decorative structures, and instead invest it into the types of services that improve mental health of people that live in the city. Especially given how much everyone allegedly cares about mental health and the connection to crime. Preferring hundreds of millions of dollars in ornamentation over improving or saving the lives of your fellow New Yorkers is sociopathic, yes."
Both can happen. You don‚Äôt have to spite something else to promote your own cause
Your original statement is dumb to even begin with.
"Suicide will always exist to some degree (for the foreseeable future anyway), but maybe society shouldn‚Äôt make things shittier for people and we can address growing suicide rates. ‚ÄúHumans can‚Äôt control themselves‚Äù is a shitty take on suicide, like it‚Äôs some personal moral failure."
"Spectacularly committing suicide by jumping off a piece of public art is wild though.  Suicide sucks, but if you're gonna do it, please don't make a big scene and traumatize a bunch of strangers."
"That said, they should just have put nets."
"I totally agree with you but we‚Äôre judging the actions of people who are literally at their wits end to the point of ending their lives. We can‚Äôt really view these actions in the view of pure logic or even thinking about other people. Why someone would do it in such a public way, I can‚Äôt even fathom, but it isn‚Äôt just coming from nowhere."
"If you ever make something that people can spectacularly commit suicide from, you can be certain that some people will take advantage of the opportunity."
Not a big fan of this whole other people can‚Äôt behave so you can‚Äôt have nice things thing we have going on.
Has anyone dived into the 9/11 memorials?
"I don't believe so, but they also intentionally designed it to be suicide-resistant.  The walls are sloped, which will slow you down, and the water is 3 feet deep, which should help cushion the impact."
A piece that can make some people think about life in such a profound level must be pretty good art.
Can't they put a net to catch anybody that jumps off?
But.... I mean come on this thing fucking sucks.
I like it. It reminds me of a bees nest.
Reminds me of gyro meat. Love it.
"Oh, I‚Äôm going to call it The Spit from now on."
I call it the Shwarma
Glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one. And yes I do like it for this reason.
""
i really like it as well. the fact that it triggers so many haters is an added bonus
I think cinnamon bagels are an abomination but if other people like them I'm OK with it.
i was in a deli just last week and some woman ordered a hot roast beef and swiss with mayo on a cinnamon raisin bagel (untoasted) and all i could think to myself was: daddy issues
"‚ÄúIf you see something, say something‚Äù applies everywhere."
Her safe word is ‚Äúchopped cheese.‚Äù
"Bacon Egg and Cheese on a cinnamon raisin bagel is amazing, but that is absolute madness"
Idk about you but I‚Äôm more offended by the mayo then the bagel choice . What kind of monster uses mayo with red meat
So none on a burger?  A chopped cheese?  A BLT?!? Who‚Äôs the real monster?
I said what I said
You wouldn't have batted an eye if it had been toasted?
"I hear ya, I'm a total ignoramus when it comes to modern art and architecture anyway so I'm sure there are some reasons why people like it."
It looks like an early-90s computer graphics technology demo
It only sucked because you needed scheduled tickets to climb stairs to nowhere
Thank you. I hate super jaded headlines like this.
Pro tip:  It's still bad.
it's definitely bad art too though.
No its not bad art.
It can be both!!!
"i mean, it's ugly to me and a blight on our skyline but if you say so."
"Its too low to be on the skyline,."
fair enough. it's not part of the skyline but i still see it every time i'm biking on the west side highway bike path.
"For me, it's ugly, it's puny, it's industrial but without function, it seems so at odds with its surroundings and it's ultimately a stairway to nowhere, seemingly created for tourists to take selfies."
"but it IS art, for better or worse. Genuinely curious why you like it, would be interested to know if you care to share."
I think it looks striking ... I climbed it several times before it closed and the experience of being inside it was quite remarkable.  I watched it be assembled from the High Line and was fascinated.
"I don't think it needs a ""destination"" when it IS the destination."
I think the copper colored steel plating is remarkable.
I don't like that its closed.
"There's nothing wrong with creating a place for tourists to interact with things either.  New York isn't just for New Yorkers after all, never has been.   In fact, the more of them that get created the less the tourists will intrude on actual local lives in a bothersome fashion."
thanks for sharing your opinions. you and i have had very different experiences with it and that's obviously informing our like or dislike of the vessel.
i hope they figure out how to open it again so you can go back to enjoying it.
"There is no ""bad art"", only art that doesn't speak to you or art that you simply do not like. I fucking hate country music but I recognize that others love it."
"Objective qualities or the way different forms of art are evaluated, change with time. Some art that may be recognized as amateurish, poorly executed or ""bad"" as you call it, can at another time in history be recognized as a masterpiece. You're wrong, you're obnoxious, you're ignorant."
Here are a few glaring examples proving you wrong:
10 Early Scathing Reviews of Works Now Considered Masterpieces
"Kumbaya my Lord. Kumbaya. Oh, Lord Kumbaya ."
"Not really, art is subjective"
I blame the art. Most other art projects don't prompt people to throw themselves off it.
"Why don't you try to understand these people who""can't control themselves""? Why do you suppose they can't control themselves?"
We can't make the world safe for every person in it. It's not possible.
""
It is not the art piece‚Äôs fault that suicidal people jump off of tall things‚Ä¶
""
""
"If they hadn't figured out and accounted for what would happen if everyone stood on one side at once because something interesting was going on they wanted to watch, would you blame the people not following the 'please distribute yourselves evenly' sign? Or the designer who didn't make it sturdy enough that it didn't depend on individual humans making good decisions on an ongoing basis to keep it stable?"
"Time to knock down all those multi-story buildings too then i guess. Convert all the bridges to tunnels too while we‚Äôre at it. Oh and no more trains, can‚Äôt risk people jumping in front of them."
"The truth is that if someone really wanted to end their own life, all they have to do is intentionally overdose. We need to focus on the root cause of suicide, not the means of doing it."
Uh why not both? Why make an attractive place for big showy suicides readily available until such time as we get our mental health care system straightened out in this country?
""
You‚Äôre really doubling down on this lol. You‚Äôre now arguing that all national parks with a tall drop and all balconies around the world be locked down.
It‚Äôs so fascinating to see someone dig into a nonsensical position
""
"When them piece of art is a set of stairs without any safety features inside to prevent people from jumping, it is the art piece's fault. Especially after the second time it happens. And the third. And the fourth. And now it's closed and nobody can walk up the $200,000,000 stairs."
"If someone jumps off a balcony is it the architects fault, too?"
"Theoretically if an architect decided to include balconies on a high rise psych ward, then yes."
"It provided the code-specified guardrail at the code-specified height. If you think the codes are too relaxed, then write to your congressman to lobby for more stringent codes. But you‚Äôre asking an architect to provide more than what is required by code? Are you equally angry that bridges and mall atriums don‚Äôt over-provide when it comes to guardrail provisions?"
You seem to just be mad at this art piece in general because the logic of your critique seems to be based on your feelings and not the actual factual conditions.
"It's still not it's fault that people choose to commit suicide there. If there were unsafe structural problems causing injury, that would be one thing but it's people jumping off out of their own volition. If you wanna blame anyone, blame the security in charge of keeping people safe or blame whoever's managing that art piece."
""
"Read my last comment again, but critically think at the same time as you read it."
r/woosh
"How the fuck does that make any sense‚Ä¶ and even if you were right, what do you propose we do? Put cages around every staircase, elevated pathway, bridge, etc in the city? If someone jumps, you don‚Äôt blame the bridge or its architect for not putting some pillows at the bottom of it."
"If you wanna be mad, be mad at how society has failed these people. Who knows why, but it probably has something to do with how hostile and shit this world has become to live in."
"without any safety features inside to prevent people from jumping,"
"Such as, what... all the guard rails it has? The guard rails that are just as tall as those on every balcony on every high-rise in the city."
"What do you want, nets?"
Is society not art that is failing‚Ä¶ mental healthcare is out of reach to most people! We are fighting each other trying to decide whether or not living wage is required for full time workers. Society blames inflation on minimum wage workers ignoring million dollar + compensations and corporate profits but it must be the minimum wage workers the reason why a house now cost over 800k in NYC
"Is the Eiffel Tower ""bad public art"" because over 300 people have committed suicide off of it since it was built?"
It‚Äôs aesthetically offensive
Also because the art is bad.
"No, the art is bad"
The art is bad though
"Why do some people get so up in arms about public spaces/art/installations/etc. that don't serve a specific purpose? I don't want to live in a place that is 100% utilitarian, so things like this can help, as can parks, attractive architecture, urban trees, and public squares."
This! It's like saying that the High-Line is dumb because it does not help my commute. Art is what you make of it. Some people like detailed sculptures and some like a dot on canvas. Not everyone has to absolutely love every expression out there.
"I mean, the Highline literally made my commute so much nicer, coming out of the Hudson Yards station and walking down the Highline instead of on the street is so much more relaxing (before I started bicycling to work which is even better)."
"Personally the most unreal part of Hudson Yards is the part no one sees, the fact that they Leveled out 33rd street between 10th and 11th instead of the Hill it used to be."
"Yeah.  I don't care for most modern art, but I understand that lots of people do like it and appreciate it."
The high line is dumb because it replaced an elevated freight rail facility with a tourist trap. The carbon cost of that stupid walking trail is incalculable.
"I don‚Äôt understand, what is the carbon cost from? And it‚Äôs not as if it would still be an active railroad line if the high line didn‚Äôt replace it"
"They didn't shut down the rail to make a park, the tracks were already long out of use and the whole thing was set to be demolished."
"Yes, but they could have been rehabilitated and put back into use and thereby saved thousands of truck trips into the city each day. The carbon savings of returning to freight rail cargo would be enormous, to say nothing of the maintenance savings given that tractor trailers do hundreds of thousands of times as much damage to roads per mile travelled."
"The ""carbon cost"" of converting abandoned infrastructure to a park full of plants?  Never heard of the addition of plants being referred to as a carbon cost."
https://www.thehighline.org/history/
"Exactly.  THere are some art installations I don't really care for, but I don't care that they are there.  It's whatever."
I don‚Äôt mind that the vessel doesn‚Äôt serve a functional purpose.
I DO mind that a giant climbable sculpture got approved without any suicide prevention measures and now it‚Äôs inaccessible because people committed suicide on it.
"It was literally just a matter of time, the outcome of someone eventually using it to off themselves was as predictable as it was inevitable."
The location of the vessel sucks too. It‚Äôs just surrounded by buildings taller than it.
It does serve a functional purpose. That purpose isn‚Äôt what society approves of so it was shut down.
I really don‚Äôt buy the whole ‚Äúit was an oversight‚Äù thing.
Could you rephrase that? Or are you actually suggesting that developers purposely built this as a means for people to commit suicide?
"Agreed.  Honestly I think I like it better as just a sculpture than when it was an ""Instagram moment"" destination."
To me it‚Äôs a suicide memorial. Just like Bobst Library at NYU.
"Yeah, people used to make grim jokes about the 'Bobst Diving Team' when I was at school"
"Same. First they put up plexi and that didn‚Äôt work, and now it‚Äôs like an artist-designed metal screen blocking any way of jumping down. Pretty sure that solved the problem, fortunately."
"I visited once, when they had the plexiglass, and the original stair railings were way too short. I‚Äôm surprised more falls didn‚Äôt happen in the past, including accidental."
"It felt so nice and airy inside with the original railings, though - definitely miss that."
Yeah I never understood how people felt safe when there were just the original railings. I think the plexi was always there when I was a student starting in 2005 but I remember being surprised by how easy it‚Äôd be to fall over without it.
"I started at NYU in 1997, and while getting an orientation tour of Bobst, the guide pointed out the suicide-discouragement built into the architecture: the brass(?) railings were shaped in such a way that if you looked down the edge of them (as you would if you were grasping them to jump over), you would see the shape of a Christian cross. Not like an ""X"", but an actual cross with the appropriate dimensions. So, if you were Christian I guess you were supposed to see it as a sign not to jump. If that didn't work, the marble flooring at the bottom was tiled in such a way to create an illusion like spikes coming up at you when seen from above. I'm not sure how discouraging that would be if you were already planning to die, but that was the idea apparently."
"At this time there were no physical barriers to jumping, and obviously that didn't work."
"Ah wow I had no idea about the cross thing! Definitely knew about the spike pattern though. Always thought that was cool, in a morbid sense I suppose."
You know that crossed my mind right after I posted.
Why do some people get so up in arms about public spaces/art/installations/etc. that don't serve a specific purpose?
"You might be being a bit broad. People like the Astor Place Cube, the Philly Love sculpture, and the Chicago Bean."
""
I suspect people don't like The Vessel because it's so large and so associated with wealth
"For me it‚Äôs definitely that. This is a piece of public art designed to attract additional investment, buyers and renters to this newly developed area, with not a lot more going for it beyond that. But the thing that really rubbed me the wrong way about was their photography policy. If you entered and photographed it, the copyright of your photographs belongs to them. If you post your photos of it in a public place, they reserved the right to use your photos at their own discretion without any additional consent from you. It just hit home for me that this is not actually a public art piece. It‚Äôs a private art piece masquerading as public art. It‚Äôs a commercial for real estate. I never climbed those stairs on principle. I‚Äòd honestly rather see it covered in graffiti."
"They wound up changing that policy, right? It was a bad one to begin with"
"The actual reason is because it‚Äôs ugly, in a location that is devoid of a sense of neighborhood."
""
I bet that if the artist had incorporated a field of wood chippers all around the bottom perimeter people would have second thoughts about jumping.
"Now that's art, baby."
That‚Äôs art that would save lives.
That would just make people jump head first.
Noooo
"Mmmm, forbidden ketchup..."
"Ironically, very nearby is the Edge, a piece of structural engineering built for public viewing from a high-up vantage point - with tall glass walls that prevent suicides."
"People declared the Eiffel Tower was ugly and would ruin the Paris skyline forever. Similarly, the original Ferris Wheel was declared an eyesore and horrifically dangerous, but immediately became a major feature of the Chicago world's fair and later a major site in many cities."
""
"Not at all, but one dude thinking it's ugly is not a good metric."
It's not just that one dude. It's pretty famously thought of as ugly.
"I kind of like it, it's shiny."
"I like pinecones, I like shiny things, voila"
I don't hate it either. Definitely not a huge fan of it though.
I too think it's an ugly larvae
But there are dozens of us! Dozens!
Comparisons are not this hard to understand.
"The comparison was on the level of people's initial reaction to the thing, not to the current status it holds as a landmark."
"But actually going with the comparison of them as structures: if we put that aside (the current 'landmark' status) and try to take a step back and look at the Eiffel Tower purely as the object that it is, especially imagining seeing it through new eyes of someone at the time it was first erected as just a random object in their town...it's not that hard to see why those people were skeptical and thought it was ugly at the time."
""
"It gained popularity over time and became an icon, but yeah, I don't see any reason that the vessel and it couldn't be compared on their merits as artistic structures if you subtract the historical fame that one has been able to accumulate over the last century+.  Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike the Eiffel Tower or something, but there's no reason to pretend it is some next-level structure that is incomparable to anything else."
Also isn't the knockoff bean the same artist as the original? That's like calling Sunflowers a knockoff of Starry Night.
Yes. Maybe I should‚Äôve used spinoff bean or three quarter bean.
"That's right, guys. The Eiffel Tower became an icon, so artistic structures can't be considered ugly anymore. That would be short-sighted!"
With a side helping of ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt afford to live near there so I‚Äôm biased towards not liking it‚Äù
Which is a substitute for ‚Äúthey destroyed the character of the neighborhood‚Äù
"Yes the wonderful character of a neighborhood defined by a shitty arena, a rat nest of a train station below it, the exit/entrance to a tunnel, a homeless shelter disguised as a bus station, and random convention center stuff. I guess B&H is neat. But before the redevelopment that are was already awful."
"This is like people whining about current Williamsburg. Ah yes, let‚Äôs remove all of the new housing on the waterfront and go back to‚Ä¶decaying warehouses and empty lots full of garbage/waste? And the gross smell from how nasty the water around the Williamsburg shoreline was due to factory dumping?"
Now you‚Äôve got something like Kent st and Domino park that has tons of awesome pedestrian traffic most weekends and people actually use
"I can‚Äôt make an argument against it being safer now, which I guess in a way is the most important thing. But at least for me, dirty, grungy, industrial, infrastructure ridden, all different kinds of people New York is much preferable to the shiny, sterile, empty, monotonous, millionaire dog walking block New York that it inches towards with every new development of this kind. I‚Äôve rarely felt unsafe in Manhattan, and I feel like all the personality of the city is evaporating in favor of a Westworld-esque hyper wealth playground. Even if it looked exactly the same aesthetically, but was middle-grade mixed use housing instead, that would make a huge difference for me. As is, it just feels like a literal monument to greed and obscene wealth."
I used to work in that area closer to Penn Station and it's always been a fucking dump with nothing for locals to give a shit about. Go north to Hells Kitchen or south to Chelsea and you can find stuff but even when I worked in the area B&H was literally the only place I ever went to outside of the Javits Center every once in a blue moon.
"I hear you. I spent a lot of time in Penn and at port authority and in the surrounding streets and buildings when I was in school for photography. There was always interesting encounters and people to see. I had many interesting conversations, and befriended a fair number of the employees working the surrounding business. For most people though, it was definitely just a transient area from one point to another."
West Side Yard rent used to be so affordable
I think its beautiful.
What if I told you that's your opinion and I don't think it's ugly. Then what do you say?
"Probably, ‚ÄúI still think it‚Äôs ugly.‚Äù You can have different opinions on art. It‚Äôs OK."
No. We are now at war. /s
It‚Äôs ugly.
""
it‚Äôs ugly
That's rather subjective...
"I agree. And the Vessel serves a purpose for sure. I‚Äôm there most days because I live there, and the square around the Vessel is always busy during the day. So many tourists, who then stroll through the mall and maybe have a snack at one of the restaurants. Synergies."
I suppose all monumental public art paid for by real estate developers in a bid to attract foot traffic to their ground level retail clients is pretty fucking cynical to begin with
that don't serve a specific purpose?
"That's not the problem. No one complains that the Vessel doesn't serve a purpose. They complain that it's bad art, on top of being a side magnet in a way few other things are."
"It really is just the worst of corporate ""art:"" shallow, uninspired, and bleak."
"I disagree so much with this. When it was open, it was genuinely a great piece of art to walk up and down. The scale of it felt monumental and significant inside - to stand inside of it to see all of the hexagonal structures made you feel like you were in a human scale honeycomb. I even wish it was designed at a larger scale so that Hudson Yards didn't literally block the view of it. It could've been a mini landmark in the city but instead is hidden away by a monstrosity of a mall."
"See, I don't get this at all: you mention that the scale felt monumental, but also that it felt small in context, but still think it was great art."
"Besides the physical beauty of a thing, my go-to for art criticism is thinking of art as a conversation: What is a work of art trying to say? What did the creator say to the work? What is the work saying to the space it's in? And every time I think about this context with the Vessel, I hit a blank. I guess it's saying hexagons are cool? Maybe something about humanity being small, but that's already accomplished better by the scope of the space it's in. The whole thing feels just like a thing that's kind of neat for a couple minutes and is immediately forgotten once you leave."
Is it really a baffling idea that an object can feel large when humans interact with it but small contextually compared to how large the buildings are around it?
Not at all. I just feel that the totality of Hudson Yards accomplishes that drinking of grandiosity better than Vessel does.
I love public art but this always felt uniquely corporate + soulless.
Do tourists flock to it?
Yes. Yes they do. They then go into the Hudson Yards Mall and neighboring restaurants and spend money.
"Is that good for the locals? I'd argue it's fine. That mall is absolutely not built for us, anyway, but if it brings money to the city, I don't care."
Because they build things that are as ugly as shit
"In The Vessel‚Äôs case it was more of blatant laundering. The Hudson Yards development received a MASSIVE tax break because of this art piece that cost $250million. Only for it to culminate in people behind the project begging the developer to change the railing design and multiple people, including children, committing suicide on it"
"Personally, I think it‚Äôs pretty cool."
All they need to do is make the glass paneling higher or put up thin nets. However I‚Äôve heard the artist behind the Vessel is totally opposed to it as it would be ‚Äúhurting his artistic expression‚Äù.
""
"For maximum jump prevention it seems like they'd need to make the paneling higher on the exterior and also put netting on the interior, effectively turning the stairs into a corridor."
"The grates or bars would need to be polished weekly, ice falls, leaves stuck, birds nesting, so much maintenance. Maybe they should just plant trees all over it"
Could be an all-weather attraction then at least.
Or people could just not jump‚Ä¶
Surround the thing with a bouncy castle.
"The Halal Guys got a free sculpture.  What a nightmare that thing was putting together, i did not envy those ironworkers in the winter time."
I heard someone suggest they drop it in the ocean to create a reef. I actually think that would be pretty cool.
"It would be disassembled before being dropped into the ocean, so while it could still function as an artificial reef, it wouldn't be the giant shawarma standing up from the ocean floor."
I envision a pineapple under the sea.
Spongebob must have been given a nice salary bump
Sad.
There‚Äôs no shortage of scrap steel
Yeah because people kept using it to kill themselves
Suicide Pinecone is what I called it
"It is a failure in terms of interactivity and lack of (obvious) foresight, but it is ultimately a gimmick to bring tourists to HY and as the article acknowledges, it is still effective in that respect."
"But yes, it was incredibly stupid to not take into consideration the risk of jumpers so as a piece of interactive art, it fell flat (pun intended)."
"When it comes to the plaza, the real failure is how underutilized that entire space is."
""
Is there anything inherent in the design that invites that?
"I think being an open-air staircase that goes up 150 feet without anything at the top makes it a more appealing, for lack of a better term, option over jumping inside the mall."
""
It seems like a bit of an anomaly that people decided to use this thing as a suicide platform.
"Statistically, you're correct. There have been what, 4 jumpers out of thousands of daily visitors at its peak?"
"But it just seems like an obvious risk that should have been taken into account, especially since all it takes is a few jumpers for the whole thing to be shut down as we have seen."
"in the mall you can walk up the stairs to go to the bathroom, order food at a diff restaurant, buy a watch etc.  whenever anyone walked to the top of the vessel the only thought was ""welp, gotta go down now."" ‚Äì i.e. there's a lot of emphasis on the descent, and that doesnt even begin to get into the nihilistic ""staircase to nowhere"" symbology..."
"""The feeling that people experience when they stand on the edge like this isn't the fear of falling - it's the fear that they might jump"""
https://youtu.be/cBkCS9yLd24?t=41
It‚Äôs a hollow shape with a staircase leading to nothing. Pretty poetic when you think about it.
"I think the elephant in the room is that some people who are suicidal want to do it in a dramatic way. Not sure what the psychology behind that is, but it needs to be recognized."

What the fuck is this obsession with the vessel? I personally think it‚Äôs cool both before and after the closure. I swear to god I see an article about how it‚Äôs a failure like once a month. Get a life.

Good band name.
LMAO
Maybe one day we will donate it to Columbus Ohio or something and forget it ever happened.
"I got to walk up it when it first opened. It was mildly interesting, I remember slightly reminding me of that drawing of the wild impossible staircase."
"That said I kind of get why they closed it. If you're in that type of mind set it's, as morbid as this sounds, an interesting place to jump and that precedent was made almost instantly. They probably don't want their structure to be known for that."
Maybe they could install some tall  plexiglass around the top rim but maybe they think that kills the look
"At least taxpayers didn't pay for it, beyond whatever tax rebates and incentives were given to the developers. Dumb rich people going to do dumb rich people things ig ü§∑"
"HY is a weird area as it is and the vessel is doubly strange in its current state of non-use, but I got to go up in it when it was still open and it was extremely cool. Hope they can figure something out."

Thanks for this. I like her.
Failure? You have thousands taking pictures with it every day and it drives ppl to the restaurants nearby.
"Let me guess, you live in Long Island dont you?"
Lots of Long Island people actually work there. Tons of offices at the yards. Made friends with lots of them.
That sounds like a horrible commute even though the LIRR goes right to Penn
"I can't speak for Long Island, but I'll go well out of my way to take the LIRR from Kew Gardens and avoid the E & F. That commute is a million times better than the subway or driving into midtown."
"LIRR runs express throughout the mornings and evenings. It has to since so many LI people make their livings in the city. A commute from parts of LI can be faster than many parts of BK and Queens. Funny thing is people act like LI is another state or some shit the same way people don‚Äôt realize Puerto Rico is part of America when LI is literally part of NYC, but people(mostly transplants)show hate for perceived cultural reasons."
"Only the very end of the island is part of nyc, nassau and suffolk arent part of the city"
I‚Äôm from here so I‚Äôm aware of the geography quite well. My LI family to me are locals.
"""LI is literally part of NYC"" only really replying to this part dude. How can they be ""locals"" if they dont live locally?"
"Same way someone from Bushwick,Astoria South Bronx, Sheepshead bay or the is a local. I also think people across the water in Jersey are locals. I think you get my point."
"I really dont dude, all the places you named are places in the city."
Ok you win.
"I imagine it‚Äôs similar to living in Bergen county NJ, where there are also express trains to Penn. And having done that for 18 months after graduating college I know it absolutely sucks"
I cant honestly say it‚Äôs any better but I can say It was way better and faster than my miserable morning subway ride from Ave U. Plus it was quieter with comfortable seats and you can actually sleep.
When did LI become a borough?
Queens and BK are on LI. Were I grew up in south BK may as well have been LI.
LI is literally not a part of NYC lol
Parts of it are. Queens and BK.
The confused look when you tell people BK and Queens are part of Long Island is pretty funny

Bc kids on this sub who moved here a couple years ago think it‚Äôs some badge of honor to live ‚Äúin the city‚Äù as if that‚Äôs something really special.
The only restaurants nearby are restaurants owned and run by giant corporations. It‚Äôs a giant cash grab that somewhat works. Let‚Äôs see how it pans out in the long term. After working for them count me as a cynic but so far so good.
So what if they are? Both the corporations and the restaurants employ people and pay rent while providing a desirable service.
Chain/corporate restaurants aren‚Äôt very desirable and it just cheapens the whole occasion of dining out
A menu shouldn‚Äôt be created in a think tank. I guarantee non of the food is truly worth what they‚Äôre charging
A lot of corporate backed restaurants offer up a great dining experience. I don't mind if they are efficient and thoughtful with designing their menu.
"I love my family owned restaurants but find nothing wrong with the fig & olives, pio pios, and Nino's of new york (all of which are backed by corporate restaurant groups)"
This is a dumb thing said by someone who has no idea what restaurants are nearby.  The closest thing to a 'chain' restaurant within ten blocks north or south of the Vessel is the Shake Shack in Hudson Yards.
He didn't say it was chain restaurants. He said that the restaurants there were owned by large corporations. The two are not mutually inclusive.
I helped build and manage one of the establishments in the yards. Let‚Äôs just say that every restaurant in the yards is part of larger corporate restaurant groups. There are no mom and pops. Some are also even in actual partnership with the yards itself. On top of that the people frequenting the yard are not the type of people to go to smaller local establishments even if there were any nearby.
Well at least give a single example?
Whitmans?
Porteno?
Kahlo?
Porchlight?
Zou Zou?
Mar?
And here I didn't even know Hudson Yards had a shake shack :-/
"You must be confused, people from Long Island would love this."

mmmmm you are so right. shave that bad boy
You too?  Thought I was the only one.
seems worth noting that it was a 100% privately funded commercial thing to enhance the real estate development and make it a destination.
"in case people want to hop on the bandwagon of 'nice public stuff is always bad and a waste of money, and if it's good it is wasted on the unwashed proles and/or just spoils them.'"
"It is a weird, not particularly attractive construction and I think there may some weird psychology at play that makes people want to jump from it."
if I was going to design a ceremonial death machine that's kind of what I would make it look like.
"Went up there and thought wow, how do they keep people from falling off this.  Then the suicides started to happen."
Buildings with accessible roofs left and right and they chose to jump off that thing?
I read the article. I don't think it was a failure. It is a very cool looking (if you're into that kind of thing) piece of public modern art in the middle of a soulless neighborhood. I think that the problem is that people suffering from mental illness do not have access to services that can be lifesaving.

I feel bad for the people behind the vessel as a whole. What a fucking bizarre issue to have with no good solutions. I don‚Äôt blame them for not seeing the problem coming.
"Also, it‚Äôs insanely dystopian when you think about it - tall structures need to be designed to be suicide-proof now. The solution to the crazy growing suicide rate is to make it more difficult to commit suicide."
Suicide shawarma

"That place is a blight. No, a stadium wouldn't have been better... but fuck, the corporate dystopia neighborhood is not good either."
"Hudson Yards is a paradox. suits walk through only to disappear into the skyscrapers (doing god knows what up there)-(American Psycho cosplay/larping?) only to reappear at Whole Foods, ShakeShack or Fuku during lunchtime. The only other inhabitants at Hudson Yards is literally the hundred thousand daily tourists who come from penn station or literally the 7 line subway station under the Vessel. There used to be charging stations and power outlets at the mall BUT 100% of them have been removed & welded shut do to loitering. I‚Äôm honestly surprised there are even still chairs available to sit on. Hudson Yards is just one giant hostile homeless spike on the Chelsea district bordering Hell‚Äôs Kitchen. not going to even mention ‚Äúthe edge‚Äù either. bleh."
"This is why there‚Äôs nowhere to sit at grand central. If you don‚Äôt make an area hostile, people will just set up camp there. We can‚Äôt have nice public amenities in nyc."
"I think we can, our leaders just hate homeless people so much they want everyone else to suffer"
"I think we can, our leaders just hate homeless people so much they want everyone else to suffer"
"I liked Hudson Yards a lot more when there was a CAMP store there. It gave my son something cheap to do on blistering Summer days, and it's really easy to roll a stroller from the LIRR and to the Highline from there ... Now that CAMP is gone from that location, it's just a place to walk through to get somewhere else. It's kinda worthless to me."
"Also, it doesn't seem to be doing any better than any other mall I've been to. Blue Bottle, FuKu and maybe Van Leeuwen seem do be the only stores with foot traffic. That's only noticed out the corner of my eye though."
"Oh, you can add the fact that with the billions they did receive, they ended up building a segregated poor building on the lowest floors of their premium condo sky scrapper during phase 1."
Do you have an article about this? I made the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs interesting about Hudson yards?‚Äù Post a few months ago
"Articles are hard to find, a lot of these stories get reported and then buried. But you can read up on some of the actual tenants that moved in and how they got away with this on the housing forums for these lotteries, but just a note that tenants did sue but the case got thrown out because they weren‚Äôt living in the apartments."
"There‚Äôs a lot of stuff on here, but worth scrolling through:"
https://www.city-data.com/forum/new-york-city-housing-lottery/3006764-553-west-30th-street-15-hudson-37.html
Stuff I picked up on:
Separate elevators and only way to access them is from the back entrance
The other tenants have access to the affordable housing elevators but their elevators are locked behind a door even though you need a key card to access floors.
"All the affordable housing tenants where put on the bottom floors and considering Hudson yards does performances all summer, the loudest part of the building. -The affordable floors have different windows from regular units, except the management office in that section of the building. The affordable housing windows all got permanently shut for 6+ months because they ended up faulty and needed to be screwed in. -No access to amenities or even the ability to pay for them, these floors have a few rooms without windows with limited equipment that pales in comparison to their normal rentals. -Airflow, every one of the apartments advertise fresh air and ventilation but the lower units lack any of this considering how busy that part of the city is. -Only related rental in the area with no washer/dryer, but they do have a pay to use laundry for these tenants."
Thank you!!
Calling it a failure because a few people decided to end their lives off of it seems unfair. There is definitely an element of social contagion to suicide locations and once it started I'm not sure there was much that could be done
It‚Äôs a failure because it was designed to be climbed and now you can‚Äôt climb it.
I love that area.  I've been to the Vessel (at night) and it was great vibes. That whole area is great vibes.
Suicide sucks but the Vessel isn't a failure
I‚Äôm confused. My wife and I were in NYC in April for the first time in maybe 8 years. We were just sitting in the benches by the vessel and I could have sworn I saw a woman letting small groups of people go up?
"You can go into the base, but you can‚Äôt go up the stairs"
They should just rename it ‚ÄúAokigahara west ‚Äú
The suicide machine
"It would have been nice if the project was designed to allow people to hang out on it, rather than simply walk up and down on it for some pictures. Public spaces where people can hang out and congregate can a lot to an area."
The whole of Hudson Yards is a failed concept.
Seems like THE VESSEL is a magnifying lens on a looming mental health crisis.
"The designer was warned but just like the luxury nightmare that is the area, no one wanted to listen to anything but money."

They should just tear it down and put grass to make it a park in the middle of Hudson yards
It took 200 million dollars to build a series of staircases?
That also looks like a giant wasps nest.
Who said this was a failure?
This is probably the best art piece installed in our city. It‚Äôs a hidden gem in a open space.
Open it back up!
"i'm not sure one of the most well-known and recognizable pieces of public art in new york city counts as a ""hidden gem"""
Who said this was a failure?
You apparently haven't spent enough time on Reddit.
Bless your soul.
"If the Vessel wasn't originally opened to the public would it still be a ""failure""? Because its a really cool art piece imo."
or if it had adequate protection against jumpers...
It‚Äôs bad enough that ‚Äúmodern art‚Äù that looks like oversized twisted paper clips exist.
"This is an evolutionary form of that garbage. It‚Äôs not real art, it‚Äôs a hobby for trust fund babies."
"Turn this crap into something useful that the city won‚Äôt build, like a parking garage or public bathrooms."

Ok super fair lol
How hard would it be to install netting?
Apparently pretty hard.
"They were experimenting with netting last April to try and re-open it, and as of today there is no netting and no access."
lmao OP getting roasted in the comments
its so ugly
Always seemed so odd that at least for the cost of the structure they couldn't just make it fully enclosed in glass or bars to the point no one can jump.
I call it the waste paper basket went to it once after comic con it's literally the walk to nowhere
"Incredibly stupid title for the article. Even if it‚Äôs never opened to the public again, it‚Äôs hardly a failure. It still draws people in and is an interesting sight to behold. There are many potential ways to critique it, but calling it a straightforward failure is clearly agenda-driven."
more stairwells that can smell like piss!
lol I love the shawarma comparison- an excellent tribute to halal
So that‚Äôs where our taxes go to subsidize things.
"I mean, we were saying it as soon as the design was released. It didn‚Äôt need to be erected to know it was a terrible idea. Can‚Äôt fathom how things like this get a green light"
"I don't get why they just can't put up some kind of thin decorative fencing like they have at the top of the Empire State Building. Maybe it screws up the sightlines a little, but it's better than just closing it entirely."
if im not mistaken the artist didnt want to compromise their work by adding such so its closed indefinitely
Why is it up to them? The artist doesn‚Äôt own it do they?
"Yeah kinda agree, I went up right around when it first opened & it was just okay. I think this would have been better say in the middle of Central Park because you would get a better view. Just were it is you can't see much except a clear view of NJ."
I thought it really fit the vibe of the development well: a giant rusty post-modern cockroach statue you kill yourself off of.
Oof! Bleak but also fair.
RIP to those who never seek help for their inner demons.
I rather like Vessel.  I think closing it was a mistake.
"Lmfaoo this will be open again right b4 summer lol they not gonna lose money because of a few deaths. From a business perspective, it's about the money.

Hopefully they will be able to reopen it at some point.
lmao you gonna compare the vessel to Eiffel Tower what a clown.
It's awesome!  :-)
It‚Äôs such a garbage piece of art I know a few people have killed themselves over it
Thoughts on The Vessel.
"Life is fascinating. In WW2 the world was murdering over 35,000 people, every 24 hours (total deaths divided days), this went on for years and years and years."
"4 people have jumped from The Vessel. Of course every death is tragic, just the idea of how much we value life in our interconnected, always on 24/7 world. We're all connected by only milliseconds between us."
The Asian flu way back when.
The experts:
"Ike,  millions of Americans WILL die, maybe far more. We have to SHUT DOWN the country."
"Ike: Over 75 million have died not that long ago, what's another 2 or 3 million more? We're not shutting down anything. You get sick you stay home, you get better, you go back to work or school."
"And we did just fine. We survived. From one of those friends, during our Covid days: ""We have to shut down NYC, weld everyone in. I can not have my grandmother die, she's that important to me. If we have to weld apartments shut like China then we do it."""
"How times have changed. Sounds like we do care now, about everyone. We are getting better at this life thing. Just takes time. We're going to Mars, we can figure out how to re-open The Vessel. It is pretty cool. Nothing else like it in the world."
"Have taken a few friends to the top, they loved it. And none of them jumped. Not a one. We managed just fine."
GPT-4
"If we divide 77.5 million by 2,194, we get an estimated average of around 35,370 deaths per day during the conflict"
This is a bizarre take
4 people jumped. We shut down the entire thing?  That's crazy.
But all that capacity coming on line really plummeted rents on the far west side. /s
I want to sneak in just to smoke a blunt at the top and get lost on all the stairs.

"I know this is a massive structure, but the average cost for city commissioned public art for a sculpture is between $350k-$1 million. Usually on the lower side."

"Vessel was a private venture tho, Related bankrolled that $200mil."
"It's not a failure. It's a architecture masterpiece that unfortunately was used to commit suicide. Ppl still flock to it. All they have to do is put up a window glass shield,  (similar to what they have on the edge), on each level all around. At this rate, it just becomes a building, but atleast it won't turn into a flop."
It's a architecture masterpiece
How?
Probably because people kept killing themselves on it.
The fact this thing was $200 million is proof that government has too much money.
It wasn‚Äôt paid for by the city
It was a good view from the top! Can‚Äôt believe so many people actually jumped from there
"How much money was wasted on this while we have homeless men, women and children in the streets?"
I like it. It‚Äôs interesting to look at. And it‚Äôs a hell of a lot better than other public art which is typically mediocre.
Why don't they install some nets?
"I went once just after it opened. They had tickets for after 3pm, but it was 1030am. We weren‚Äôt planning on being in midtown all day. It was just as well. My friend could do a lot of walking but that many stairs would‚Äôve been torture"
The call of the void is strong
"I wonder if they can open up the first few levels. Like ‚Äúserious injury height, but not enough to assuredly kill you.‚Äù"
Sad i never got to try the bungee jump
"You know, nets are cheap. Just ask Foxcon."
"Dang. I always wanted to walk up that thing. Walking past it a couple weeks back, I was wondering why it wasn't possible to climb that thing."
It's just sad that this thing became a suicide magnet. That's really tragic.
"This may come across as cold, but if we just open it up and let people kill themselves, won‚Äôt enough people finally do it that we kind of run out? I don‚Äôt understand the difference between this being open and being able to jump off the bridges without too much effort."
are you suggesting that depression is a limited resource?    Really?
Are people committing suicide off the edge too?
I love the progression of the thing
I was lucky to be able to climb and take some pics. Nice view of Hudson yards and the high line from the top but anybody with two bits of common sense knew someone was going to jump from that thing and kill themselves.
Literally everyone predicted it would be a failure.
At least I got to go to the top before it closed.
People aren‚Äôt killing themselves because this exists. I don‚Äôt really see why they need to stop people from killing themselves there specifically compared to other places. If someone is determined they‚Äôll just kill themselves somewhere else. People kill themselves on train tracks and bridges all the time and nobody says to shut them down.
‚ÄúWhat a nice tall building. Think I‚Äôll kill myself by jumping off of it‚Äù
"Yes, an entirely wonderful piece of art!"
Then people started committing suicide.
Tragic.
"Then, the pandemic."
So sad.
NYC's gigantic failure is still the lack of Public Toilets.
Could they just extend the glass railings?
This thing is absolutely atrocious looking and remarkably pointless
Wasn‚Äôt Hudson yards undeveloped bc it has no public transit to it?
"I clicked on this just to confirm it was, in fact, referencing Hudson yards."
I always wanted to go but never got the chance smh can‚Äôt give people nothing nice these days
"Fuck, I didn‚Äôt realize 4 people jumped to their death from it. Not surprised and I‚Äôve hated it since it‚Äôs inception. Just tear it down and put some public greenery space in its place"
The architect needs to stop being a tied and just allow a safety net
"Imo, it always looked ugly and I never understood the point"
something about it makes it perfect to jump off of
