"That sounds bad but give it a year and people probably wont even remember that its named vessel, so theyd probably forget that name too (meaning its unlikely to negatively effect our lives even if we gave it a name that was ugly in an effort to get some money out of it by selling advertising in the name)."
Do New York City residents even know what a bowl in that context is?

"I read about this in the Guardian. I have had a misfortune to live in badly planned areas like this, with buildings with shitty architecture. It is really sad that developers and architects have become so arrogant that they can't even comprehend what beauty is. And then we are stuck with shit like this, because there's a huge sunk cost to these projects, no matter how ridiculous it looks."
