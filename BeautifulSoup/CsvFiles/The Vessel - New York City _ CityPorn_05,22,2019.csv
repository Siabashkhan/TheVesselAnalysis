Is this just a giant staircase? What’s at the top?
True love
Can I get my money back?
It’s free
"Hah, no I meant because I didn’t find true love..."
Maybe next time then. Don’t give up hope!
Wait... on getting my money back?
YOU DIDN'T SPEND ANY MONEY!
The real staircase was the friends we made along the way.
The best location to film a villian-spy talk scene in the next James Bond movie.
Or a chase scene on motorcycles.
Or some slapstick comedy chase where they run in and out of the frame at different levels on the stairs.
I was thinking this too when I was there. So much potential for a cool scene
Views.
Nothing. It’s a staircase for staircase’s sake
lmao americans are so dumb just a stupid metal staircase thank god I live in a real place with truly innovative monuments like the eiffel tower
what are ur thougts on geraffes??
Two Monogatari characters arguing about some weird shit
"Nothing. It exists for taking selfies. It's all stairs, you're not even allowed to ride the elevator up unless you're handicapped."
China
Agreed. I see this almost everyday and I don’t get it.
More stairs
"Bowser, assuming u got the prequisite number of stars"
Looks like a Halo map.
This was my first thought when I saw that building
Looks like looking out of a Lamborghini
Is this a real place I can visit?
Yes.  It's at the new Hudson Yards complex.
"And it’s also free! A little bit of a wait time, but they make sure it’s never over crowded so you can enjoy the space."
I only had to wait about hour and a half. They gave us a ticket with a time to come back and we got in right away then.
"Boom, ticketed."
And just so you know technically Hudson yards now owns your photo.
Edit: apparently they changed their policy back in March because they realized they were a bunch of schmucks.
They own it now because I posted it here?
Wasn’t aware of that.
""
And not how the law actually works lol
Thanks!
"I was just reading up on it, I still own the photo but they have the right to post it if they want, which most museums and other locations similar seem to have."
But reddit owns it because he posted it here right?
So like...what is it?
Yes it is. It's designed by Thomas Heatherwick. Have a look in his website. He's designed some amazing architecture.
"He calls himself a designer, not architect"
"Didn't know that, thanks!"
"You can visit, but you never should."
Why?
"Don’t really want to get into it, but Hudson Yards is a neoliberal monstrosity that exists as a destination solely to allow the Instagram crowd to perform acts of self fellatio."
You sound like my old architecture theory prof—what’s your opinions on Gehry?
then don’t go there and let other people enjoy things.
"This, but it’s a good thing."
Whenever I see photos of it I always wonder if it's perfectly symmetrical.
it’s not because there is a lift in one side
"Yeah the lift creates some closed off walls, which kinda makes a small maze of stairs for you. Haha."

They are currently looking for a permanent name for this structure.
"Popular names in NY are the acorn, or the Sharma."
The Vessel.
Nailed it.
The Loofah
I just went there on Sunday! My calves are finally not on fire lol
It looks like something out a superhero movie
The cleaning crew must loooove this.
Why did this get built? In all honesty. What goes on there?
"i know in San Francisco, any major construction project, a portion of the budget must be spent on public art. This could be true for NYC as well."
Damn
Its one of the more controversial projects along with Hudson Yards itself. I remember when they were building it my boyfriend and I would have debates on what it was. I called it the beehive.
"I visited last week for the first time. we took the train from elmsford, then the subway to Hudson yards. this is one of the very first things I saw when I was officially in nyc. very interesting structure"
Inspired by Indian stairwells in Rajasthan.
How is it that this cost $200 million?
"Does that include the land that it's built on? Because that area is currently being developed like crazy...I work in a restaurant near there, and the construction sounds are a nightmare."
"I am not the expert, so I'm not sure. The whole Hudson Yards project is about 28 acres and is expected to cost $18 billion. I reckon that since the land upon which the Vessel sits is part of the 28 acres and was funded by its developer that land cost was not a factor."
"Maybe. I'm in this area every day, but I'm really not sure what's going on with it. All I know is that they're building more luxury apartments."
"Not really. Most of Hudson Yards is office (10, 30, 50 and 55 for HY proper and then the Spiral and 3HB next to it). The residential component isn't as big as most people think it is."
Fair enough. I was just chatting with some construction dudes who've become lunch regulars the other day and they're working on a residential on 31st and 9th and they were talking about some on 33rd and 34th that were going up this year as well.
It was made in Italy
$100 million to build it and $100 million to design it.
"I mean, it's pretty big, and it's not like they were just building your standard warehouse or whatever that has been done a hundred million times already. There were probably a lot of design and engineering hurdles that they came across that they had to come up with novel solutions for."
This would make a one cool arena for Unreal Tournament-style deathmath FPS.
Yes! Before we knew It was a staircase to nowhere I thought it would be a parking garage OR a place where rich people would come to watch us fight to our deaths.
"Hudson Yards: After a nice stroll, I like to buy five Rolexes in five different stores"
Fuck Hudson Yards! This is a part of a corrupt development that funneled money from public housing projects to a luxury development by exploiting a loophole in zoning.

you are surprised NYC politics is corrupt?
What is this the tranquility base hotel and casino?
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️/⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Too bad they own the rights to this now

I love this structure and love to see people enjoying it. It's like a vertical park.
simply stunning
Are there elevators in this building?
"You can sort see to the left, there’s a lift to the top, but it’s only for people with disabilities."
horrific monstrosity
Someone give the stair master salesman a raise. What a giant waste of money.

Edit: [from the article]
"Hudson Yards only qualified for the program because it was looped into the same ""targeted employment area"" as several public housing developments in Harlem, according to the report. For an area to qualify as a targeted employment area it needs to meet the standard of 150% unemployment compared to the national rate."
"For reference, from Harlem to Hudson Yards: Walking - 1h 51m Subway - 37m Taxi - 31m (no traffic)"
"Way to take my specific comment as a general outlook on life. I helped build the Hudson yards, I watched that overpriced goofy installation process. With all the talent and money invested not only in the project but the city, yes this is silly.  Art is relative viewpoints are different, I guess I’ll head back to my trailer park."
Legislated street art requirements usually produce garbage art installations that are only there to really fill the requirement to build. Money could be better spent. Not trying discouraging art or artists.
Beautiful but all those stairs are not efficient at all
Efficiency wasn’t the point
