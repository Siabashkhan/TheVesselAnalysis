It'd be so cool to fight Venom or Electro in that thing.
Sandman could also be amazing
I can see a giant Sandman construct and the spider-men climbing all around to avoid attacks.
just to give this post some action: what the fuck is the vessel?
A giant stair building
Do people actually use it and like walk on top of it?
"They used to, but it was closed when people kept killing themselves jumping off it ."
Damn there is always someone to ruin the fun
i think it was a kid
"It was serval people, one of which was a college student from Connecticut if Iâ€™m not mistaken"
ayy shout out CT in the building /s
thatâ€™s sad tho
"Wow thatâ€™s kinda fucked up, says a lot when the only reason itâ€™s closed to people is because so many people wanted to kill themselves"
That got dark fast
ðŸ’€
"Not anymore. The stairs are blocked off due to too many ""sewer slides"". Might even be why they left it out of the game"
its got a controversial history unfortunately
"Are you referring to the suicides, the lack of disabled access, the copyright issues"
Or D. All of the above
"I hate copyright, it's the reason I can only take photos of the Eiffel Tower during the day"
I've heard of the copyright but why does that stop you from taking pics at night? If you take them and just don't post them aren't you fine?
"The lights on the Eiffel Tower were installed after it was built, which was before some major copyright laws were introduced. There it exists in this kind of Limbo where it is and isn't okay to profit from it. Speaking of, yeah, it's fine to have photos, maybe even post them somewhere if you aren't benefiting monetarily. Also keep in mind, not exactly a layer, so I can't say anything for certain"
I too am not a layer.
Let me fight Mysterio in the natural history museum
Only if itâ€™s fully accessible and the home of a boss right where you have mostly free range for the fight. (Like the Taskmaster fights)
Wtf? I went to New York last summer and never even knew this existed!
Itâ€™s in Hudson Yards
You thought you already saw everything in NY?
Right ðŸ˜­ itâ€™s a big place
Yes Iâ€™d love for it to be added to the game!
"Yes, Iâ€™m well aware of its shitty history."
Iâ€™d like to see the intrepid maybe? And for them to maybe not skip so many streets
"Why not all of them? I mean, if they delivery the same map it's gonna be frustrating as hell. At least Queens and Brooklyn should be in the game. And much much more interior to explore."
As much as they can. When they added personality to Harlem in the Miles game it added so much. They should try to diversify and add cool stuff to the whole map. FiDi should feel different from West Village and so on.
Also get Chrysler building and One World Trade (it was in the pre-launch trailers) back in.
Giant Pine cone
As a new yorker fuck the nest lmao
"I dunno about the Vessel, since having Spidey jump from the top could be in poor taste"
Always hated that thing and Iâ€™ve lived in NY for 6 years
The new addition to the Guggenheim
I've never seen this before and I have to say this is super fucking cool.
"Thanks for the post OP, genuinely such a sick piece of architecture"
Instead of the shotgun Kraven's just gonna go here after he's beaten.
What the hell is this? Is it real?
Yep
"It would be nice if they could, but I suspect there are a lot of licensing challenges to do that. The freedom tower for instance does not hold up if you go to compare side by side."
That looks like it'd be the epicenter of so many glitches.
That has to be a collision mapping nightmare! But it would be pretty sweet.
the death pinecone
ADD THE SUICIDE PINECONE
lol just yesterday I read a story were Pete and MJ hung out in the vessel
"As someone who has never been to New York, at this point they could add any random thing and I would just assume it's a real life landmark... lol"
"4 people died jumping off of it, including a 14 year old only 2 years ago, which is why itâ€™s closed. I think it would be in very poor taste to make it something Spider-Man can jump off of. Plus theyâ€™re very strict with copyright, so itâ€™s not even worth it."
"people can jump off any building to their death, câ€™mon, I understand and empathize with those families but youâ€™re telling me a game primarily for kids and teens shouldnâ€™t have a REAL LIFE landmark just because someone did something they couldâ€™ve (and have) done on any building?"
"Correct, the difference is most buildings arenâ€™t known as suicide destinations. They literally had to close down the Vessel because of that. Itâ€™s very different than other buildings."
"Would you also not want the eiffel tower or the golden gate bridge shown in media, since theyâ€™re suicide destinations?"
Golden gate bridge has entered the chat
"Definitely the Apollo Theater, I know they left it out because of how they had to condense Harlem but it would still be cool to see, I also desperately wanna see the Chrysler Building and George Washington Bridge return, I also would love to see One WTC actually look like the real thing and lastly, an actually accessible Liberty and Ellis Island would be amazing"
"They should add the entire Hudson Yards area. That whole neighborhood has been completely redeveloped, (New skyscrapers, new observation deck, new public areas) and looks nothing like how it did when the first game came out. Also, work out whatever deal needs to be made to include the Oculus, World Trade Center and 9/11 memorial. I'd just like to see them."
"Also, add Rockefeller University, on the Upper East Side. Only because I work there, and it would be fun to see it."
Ground Zero so I can pose while taking a picture.
Dude web zipping through that would be so tasty.
4 Freedoms Plaza and or the Baxer Building
That would be an awesome map for a combat challenge.
I went here once as a kid but I was too scared to climb the higher floors because I was scared of heights
