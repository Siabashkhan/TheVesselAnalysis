"One of my local hot spots (NY) is the Kingston Rhinecliff Bridge. It‚Äôs high over the Hudson with low guide rails. Beautiful views, but it‚Äôs best seen from inside a moving vehicle because of next to no amenities on either side and continuous crosswinds. It‚Äôs been a jumper magnet since it opened in the 50s, and when the wind is up it‚Äôs an unsettling experience even in a heavy vehicle. You get on the bridge, and your first instinct is to get across the thing as soon as possible. It‚Äôs safe, but it‚Äôs never going to feel safe.",topic_12,0.43008423,Positive
