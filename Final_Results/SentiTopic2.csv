"There was a guy maybe like 12ish years back who decided to do himself at Niagara Falls.  It was late winter / early spring and there chunks of ice the size of cars flowing over the falls.  Guy jumps in above the falls and goes over.  People called 911 immediately.  Somehow he managed not to drown or get crushed, but it took like 20 minutes or more for a helicopter to spot the guy a good way down river, in near freezing water littered with massive ice chunks.  So the helicopter approaches the guy and throw out a heaving line.  I believe it was a tour company chopper, not like military search and rescue with swimmers and baskets etc.  The guy kept swimming away from them.  Eventually the fire department guys got some kind of watercraft out there, and fished him out, alive.",topic_2,-0.029991005,Neutral

Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The outer layer is sliced into thin shavings as it cooks. The vertical rotisserie was invented in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, and doner kebab inspired similar dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Greek gyros, and Mexican al pastor.",topic_2,0.029991003,Neutral
