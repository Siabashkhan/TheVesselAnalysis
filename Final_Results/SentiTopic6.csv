This doesn't include the revenues MTA receives from tickets. In order words, while your point is kinda true that the subway needs to be improved, this issue isn't a rarity in US. Though, subways are only useful in cities. Also, the cost is extremely minute compared to the revenue NY state gov receives in a year alone.
