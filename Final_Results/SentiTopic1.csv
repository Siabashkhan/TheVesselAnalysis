"\There should be official assisted-suicide centers and specialists, too, so you don't do it in a public place or kill other people by accident on your way out.

For a structure like this, I have no idea how suicide prevention was never brought up by code officials. I think it looks nice in its context, and wouldn’t like to have it torn down.
