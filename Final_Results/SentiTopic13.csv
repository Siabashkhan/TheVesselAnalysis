Why was it closed down?,topic_13,-0.3274774,Negative
Unfortunately 4 people jumped off it. It was briefly closed after 3 and new rules were put in place preventing a single person from entering the structure as well as a cost to enter to help fund further safety measures. It reopened a lil later until after a 4th person jumped. It has been closed ever since. They have recently allowed people to walk inside the middle of it on the ground floor but still prevent people from going up the stairs,topic_13,-0.5783634,Negative

Well I just mean the structure as a whole basically is closed. Sure you can still walk in it at ground level but the main purpose of it was to walk around it. Hopefully they'll be able to open it fully in the future,topic_13,0.039978687,Neutral

They did add a section of wire fencing enclosing the gaps to see what it would look like. It certainly did detract from the appearance but the section was removed and nothing has happened since.
