"For example, in Atalese v. U.S. Legal Services Group, L.P. (2014), the New Jersey Supreme Court stated that having favored status does not mean every arbitration clause will be enforceable. It added that the preference for arbitration is not without limits; an arbitration agreement may be invalidated by generally applicable state-law contract defenses. Applying such defenses, the court proceeds to find the provision unenforceable: “The absence of any language in the arbitration provision that plaintiff was waiving her statutory right to seek relief in a court of law renders the provision unenforceable.”",topic_8,-0.14888504,Neutral
"It explained that an agreement to arbitrate, just as with any contract, “must be the product of mutual assent, as determined under customary principles of contract law.” The court made it clear that a party is not required to arbitrate an issue when it has not agreed to do so. The court went on to state that for mutual assent, the party must have an understanding of the terms to which they have agreed. It observed that an average member of the public may not realize that arbitration is a substitute to one’s right to have a claim addressed in a court of law. Hence, it is necessary that the contract language be sufficient to place the signer on notice that he or she is waiving a constitutional or statutory right to trial. The Atalese court noted that the arbitration agreement at issue was located on page nine of a twenty-three page contract. Further, the clause did not explain what arbitration was, how it differs from a trial by jury, or that the right to a trial was being waived.  The court ruled the agreement violated a basic principle of contract law and was therefore unenforceable.”",topic_8,-0.039978683,Neutral

"For me it’s definitely that. This is a piece of public art designed to attract additional investment, buyers and renters to this newly developed area, with not a lot more going for it beyond that. But the thing that really rubbed me the wrong way about was their photography policy. If you entered and photographed it, the copyright of your photographs belongs to them. If you post your photos of it in a public place, they reserved the right to use your photos at their own discretion without any additional consent from you. It just hit home for me that this is not actually a public art piece. It’s a private art piece masquerading as public art. It’s a commercial for real estate.
