"Realistically , I doubt they are going to tear it down so I think there needs to be measures taken to safe guard it.

More to the point - I love Vessel. Wouldn‚Äôt change anything about it. It‚Äôs both unique and functional. Would another metal globe be better? A statue of some revolutionary hero? A water fountain?

I work in the arts and at first I thought it was at least an interesting sculptural piece of architecture (though hated the whole concept of developing the area for the ultra rich) but ever since the first person jumped, that is all I can see when I look at it. Why after the first person jumped off it did they not put up physical barriers? Does the architect or developer object to it for aesthetic reasons?

"I haven‚Äôt been to that new floating park yet, but looking at pics, I like the idea of that much more. Still futuristic but by including nature, it reminds me of some of the cool greenspaces you see in photos of Singapore.  I‚Äôm also a fan of the greenery on the Highline, thought that was genius to freshen up and give ‚Äúlife‚Äù to what used to be pretty derelict looking stuff. They‚Äôve added lots of greenery to the East River and I think that‚Äôs looking much more lively and fresh too. In China, they‚Äôve added miles and miles of flowers and greenery to highways and roads, it surprisingly does a lot to make it look nice. You can see I have a preference here :). What if it was all green plants and flowers along the exterior of the Vessel?  The shape is still kinda interesting but would make it less ugly to me.",topic_5,0.71629786,Positive
"The vessel becoming a landmark for suicide is such a perfect legacy for Related and the entire Hudson Yards project.

"They are probably going to need to add glass or bars on the exteriors to prevent people from jumping off. I don't think they'd add netting because the shape of the structure makes the addition really problematic. I think they should probably remove the group entry requirement after these changes are made because I don't think it's that much of a deterrent (they'll place you in a group if you don't have one yourself), and I think physical changes are ultimately necessary if the vessel is to remain accessible to the public.",topic_5,-0.5079774,Negative

The Vessel is the same as these examples.
