I feel like the endless staircase to nowhere set in a soulless shopping center was a little too on the nose. It's just endless influencers and death, with no real utility or function. Sure it's a beehive, but buildings shaped like other things isn't really exciting either.

It just takes up a lot of space to emphasize how expensive and purposeless it is."", 'Sure, but one is a public park and one is a memorial, which isn\'t traditional development.

There are huge plexiglass barriers on all of the levels to prevent what used to be very regular suicides. I still can not believe they built this thing at all. Who wants a view of New Jersey? Also the Empire State Building is like six blocks east, and also has massive barriers to prevent anyone from going over. A lot of bridges have suicide barriers, and some of the larger and more famous bridges have had barriers added to them during the past four years. It sounded like a terrible idea before it was built, and it is. How this thing was given a green light is beyond me.']"

Yes it encourages shopping but there’s no such thing as a totally free lunch. A low or normal income family or frugal individual can easily pack a lunch and take a free trip to the area and enjoy the attraction, just like they do at the high line, or at Chelsea piers water front. I disagree with it being wasted space. Cities like San Francisco have beautiful urban hikes and parks with panoramic views of the city all around. Manhattan really lacks that and has become nothing but offices and housing. Putting more housing (preferably affordable housing) alone won’t solve that. Also I don’t really ever see many affordable housing projects go up in Manhattan where the cost of living is so high. Why house low income people where a sandwich costs $13. To force them to go above 96th street or to none trendy parts of other boroughs to enjoy a meal?', 'Waste of space is my biggest gripe with it, beyond it being ugly. New York used to build things people actually needed like public housing and beautiful parks. On what remaining empty space the city has its tragic that the direction the city has turned to is luxury housing and pointless projects like Hudson Yards.
