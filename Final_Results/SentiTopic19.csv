Lmao I remember when the renderings came out the first thing my colleagues (architects) and I said was someone‚Äôs gonna jump from it. It‚Äôs a cool concept but a waste of money and now def going to be useless if they they close it again.

They were 'influenced by images of Indian stepwells' but such a huge part of why those stepwells are so aesthetically pleasing is the lack of handrails/guards.
