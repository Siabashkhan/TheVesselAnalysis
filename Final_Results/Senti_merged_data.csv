Guy jumps in above the falls and goes over.  People called 911 immediately.  Somehow he managed not to drown or get crushed, but it took like 20 minutes or more for a helicopter to spot the guy a good way down river, in near freezing water littered with massive ice chunks.  So the helicopter approaches the guy and throw out a heaving line.  I believe it was a tour company chopper, not like military search and rescue with swimmers and baskets etc.  The guy kept swimming away from them.  Eventually the fire department guys got some kind of watercraft out there, and fished him out, alive.",topic_2,-0.029991005,Neutral

Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The outer layer is sliced into thin shavings as it cooks.

This doesn't include the revenues MTA receives from tickets. In order words, while your point is kinda true that the subway needs to be improved, this issue isn't a rarity in US. Though, subways are only useful in cities. Also, the cost is extremely minute compared to the revenue NY state gov receives in a year alone.

The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire‚Äôs flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It‚Äôs not desiring the fall; it‚Äôs terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt!‚Äô and ‚ÄòHang on!‚Äô, can understand the jump. Not really.

"For example, in Atalese v. U.S. Legal Services Group, L.P. (2014), the New Jersey Supreme Court stated that having favored status does not mean every arbitration clause will be enforceable. It added that the preference for arbitration is not without limits; an arbitration agreement may be invalidated by generally applicable state-law contract defenses. Applying such defenses, the court proceeds to find the provision unenforceable: ‚ÄúThe absence of any language in the arbitration provision that plaintiff was waiving her statutory right to seek relief in a court of law renders the provision unenforceable.‚Äù",topic_8,-0.14888504,Neutral
"It explained that an agreement to arbitrate, just as with any contract, ‚Äúmust be the product of mutual assent, as determined under customary principles of contract law.‚Äù The court made it clear that a party is not required to arbitrate an issue when it has not agreed to do so. The court went on to state that for mutual assent, the party must have an understanding of the terms to which they have agreed. It observed that an average member of the public may not realize that arbitration is a substitute to one‚Äôs right to have a claim addressed in a court of law. Hence, it is necessary that the contract language be sufficient to place the signer on notice that he or she is waiving a constitutional or statutory right to trial. The Atalese court noted that the arbitration agreement at issue was located on page nine of a twenty-three page contract. Further, the clause did not explain what arbitration was, how it differs from a trial by jury, or that the right to a trial was being waived.  The court ruled the agreement violated a basic principle of contract law and was therefore unenforceable.‚Äù",topic_8,-0.039978683,Neutral

Every single high floor landmark in NYC has fences or very tall glass. When people saw the plans for the Vessel many were concerned about the railings not being high enough.
