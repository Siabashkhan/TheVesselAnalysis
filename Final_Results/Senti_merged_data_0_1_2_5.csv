Guy jumps in above the falls and goes over.  People called 911 immediately.  Somehow he managed not to drown or get crushed, but it took like 20 minutes or more for a helicopter to spot the guy a good way down river, in near freezing water littered with massive ice chunks.  So the helicopter approaches the guy and throw out a heaving line.  I believe it was a tour company chopper, not like military search and rescue with swimmers and baskets etc.  The guy kept swimming away from them.  Eventually the fire department guys got some kind of watercraft out there, and fished him out, alive.",topic_2,-0.029991005,Neutral

Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The outer layer is sliced into thin shavings as it cooks. The vertical rotisserie was invented in the 19th-century Ottoman Empire, and doner kebab inspired similar dishes such as the Arab shawarma, Greek gyros, and Mexican al pastor.",topic_2,0.029991003,Neutral

PAWWWWLLLL dat Vessel ain't played nobody,topic_5,-0.05992812,Neutral
"That sounds bad but give it a year and people probably wont even remember that its named vessel, so theyd probably forget that name too (meaning its unlikely to negatively effect our lives even if we gave it a name that was ugly in an effort to get some money out of it by selling advertising in the name).",topic_5,-0.7013741,Negative
HY is on a roll with all this free publicity lately. Pictures submitted on Reddit almost daily. The whole Vessel pics belong to them thing. Now help us come up with a name.,topic_5,0.22602835,Neutral
"Everyone already calls it 'Vessel', so just stick with that?",topic_5,-0.21651806,Neutral
"Do they know what happened with Boaty McBoatface, right guys? Guys?",topic_5,-0.14888504,Neutral
just to give this post some action: what the fuck is the vessel?,topic_5,-0.680476,Negative
"I dunno about the Vessel, since having Spidey jump from the top could be in poor taste",topic_5,-0.5915194,Negative
lol just yesterday I read a story were Pete and MJ hung out in the vessel,topic_5,0.12927258,Neutral
"Correct, the difference is most buildings aren‚Äôt known as suicide destinations. They literally had to close down the Vessel because of that. It‚Äôs very different than other buildings.",topic_5,-0.47770005,Negative
"Last time I was at HY a friend said something similar‚Äîwe were on the top floor looking out the windows at the Vessel and he looks down and says, ‚ÄúWhat do you need that for? Take a header right here!‚Äù",topic_5,0.07982977,Neutral

Is that why they closed the Vessel? Were people jumping off it?,topic_5,-0.37994897,Negative
I‚Äôll take the vessel,topic_5,0.019997345,Neutral
thanks for sharing your opinions. you and i have had very different experiences with it and that's obviously informing our like or dislike of the vessel.,topic_5,0.31852078,Positive
I don‚Äôt mind that the vessel doesn‚Äôt serve a functional purpose.,topic_5,-0.5153593,Negative
The location of the vessel sucks too. It‚Äôs just surrounded by buildings taller than it.,topic_5,-0.7352223,Negative
I suspect people don't like The Vessel because it's so large and so associated with wealth,topic_5,-0.597982,Negative
"It gained popularity over time and became an icon, but yeah, I don't see any reason that the vessel and it couldn't be compared on their merits as artistic structures if you subtract the historical fame that one has been able to accumulate over the last century+.  Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike the Eiffel Tower or something, but there's no reason to pretend it is some next-level structure that is incomparable to anything else.",topic_5,-0.06988588,Neutral
"I agree. And the Vessel serves a purpose for sure. I‚Äôm there most days because I live there, and the square around the Vessel is always busy during the day. So many tourists, who then stroll through the mall and maybe have a snack at one of the restaurants. Synergies.",topic_5,0.66959023,Positive
"That's not the problem. No one complains that the Vessel doesn't serve a purpose. They complain that it's bad art, on top of being a side magnet in a way few other things are.",topic_5,-0.641077,Negative
I heard someone suggest they drop it in the ocean to create a reef. I actually think that would be pretty cool.,topic_5,0.7013741,Positive
"It would be disassembled before being dropped into the ocean, so while it could still function as an artificial reef, it wouldn't be the giant shawarma standing up from the ocean floor.",topic_5,-0.089757785,Neutral
What the fuck is this obsession with the vessel? I personally think it‚Äôs cool both before and after the closure. I swear to god I see an article about how it‚Äôs a failure like once a month. Get a life.,topic_5,-0.7064193,Negative
10% are holding fish?,topic_5,-0.03997868,Neutral
"HY is a weird area as it is and the vessel is doubly strange in its current state of non-use, but I got to go up in it when it was still open and it was extremely cool. Hope they can figure something out.",topic_5,-0.18774618,Neutral
"This is it for me. HY feels weird and uninviting to me, a native NYer, but the vessel is fine to me. My wife thinks it‚Äôs neat.",topic_5,0.65270674,Positive
I feel bad for the people behind the vessel as a whole. What a fucking bizarre issue to have with no good solutions. I don‚Äôt blame them for not seeing the problem coming.,topic_5,-0.73978305,Negative
I love that area.  I've been to the Vessel (at night) and it was great vibes. That whole area is great vibes.,topic_5,0.7530659,Positive
Suicide sucks but the Vessel isn't a failure,topic_5,-0.6858091,Negative
I‚Äôm confused. My wife and I were in NYC in April for the first time in maybe 8 years. We were just sitting in the benches by the vessel and I could have sworn I saw a woman letting small groups of people go up?,topic_5,-0.2821348,Negative
Seems like THE VESSEL is a magnifying lens on a looming mental health crisis.,topic_5,-0.52266544,Negative
"If the Vessel wasn't originally opened to the public would it still be a ""failure""? Because its a really cool art piece imo.",topic_5,0.55805224,Positive
"Incredibly stupid title for the article. Even if it‚Äôs never opened to the public again, it‚Äôs hardly a failure. It still draws people in and is an interesting sight to behold. There are many potential ways to critique it, but calling it a straightforward failure is clearly agenda-driven.",topic_5,-0.51535934,Negative
I rather like Vessel.  I think closing it was a mistake.,topic_5,0.10955847,Neutral
The Vessel looks like an ugly oversized expensive pine cone. Some mindless hoards will flock to anything that‚Äôs shiny & new just to post their ‚Äúexperience on social media‚Äù,topic_5,-0.680476,Negative
lmao you gonna compare the vessel to Eiffel Tower what a clown.,topic_5,-0.7013741,Negative

"4 people have jumped from The Vessel. Of course every death is tragic, just the idea of how much we value life in our interconnected, always on 24/7 world. We're all connected by only milliseconds between us.",topic_5,-0.63514894,Negative
"How times have changed. Sounds like we do care now, about everyone. We are getting better at this life thing. Just takes time. We're going to Mars, we can figure out how to re-open The Vessel. It is pretty cool. Nothing else like it in the world.",topic_5,0.7113937,Positive
This is a bizarre take,topic_5,-0.69625765,Negative
