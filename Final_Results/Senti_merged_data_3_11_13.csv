"I am a native New Yorker and I don't understand the hype vehind the Vessel. It was neat at first to see something new in a neighborhood I didn't really frequent. But since then, it has just been a monument of the stupid-rich and an unfortunate place for people to take their lives. I feel like everyone I've spoken to (other native New Yorkers) have indifferent to strongly negative feelings towards the structure and the development of Hudson Yards in general. Non-native New Yorkers (transplants and visitors) seem to have more of a positive take on the whole thing. I wanted to ask for everyone's opinion.",topic_3,-0.5849799,Negative

"They’re not charging admission for Hudson Yards, they’re charging for admission to the Vessel. Not saying I agree with it, but it’s not ‘illegal’. Also a public park is way different than a POPS, apples and oranges",topic_3,-0.27290508,Negative
"You must've not been there recently. The trees surrounding the Vessel have grown quite a lot and make it quite verdant. But not everything needs to be a forest...

"Tons of people claiming the Vessel needs to be demolished - I'm just trying to gauge what is a good replacement. Everyone seems to say the same thing: park.

"And I’ve informed you of all the green space in and around Hudson Yards. And yes, more green space is always welcome and we’ve gotten it or will get it eventually. You would also be kidding if you don’t think they haven’t at least tried around the vessel. Might it be poor design, sure. But that doesn’t mean there wasn’t at least an attempt. Not all design will be good, just like not everything of anything in this world will also be good. Let’s not also forget that the vessel and the immediate surrounding is not meant to be parkland but to serve more as a plaza or central space, because again not everything needs to be parkland.  The parkland portion of it is directly north from 33rd to 36th and also directly west whenever phase 2 commences.",topic_3,0.5441271,Positive

I’m a fan of Hudson Yards. Always have been and always will be. It isn’t perfect and there are changes I would have made if I had a say - but overall I think it’s an outstanding addition to the city.
