There is an elevator.,topic_17,0.1194273,Neutral
"So many people don't seem to know this.  I haven't gone up (but wouldn't mind it), but it was interesting seeing how they fit an elevator with rails up the inside curve of the structure.",topic_17,0.5005202,Positive
it’s not because there is a lift in one side,topic_17,-0.07982977,Neutral
Are there elevators in this building?,topic_17,0.0,Neutral
"You can sort see to the left, there’s a lift to the top, but it’s only for people with disabilities.",topic_17,0.049958374,Neutral
I think the quickest way to a restroom is to enter where the art gallery is (33rd and 10th?) and take one of those elevators to the 4th floor. The restrooms were right around the corner from the elevators. Those were empty while the ones on lower floors had lines.,topic_17,0.089757785,Neutral
"My friend was there Saturday, and it was so crowded there were lines to escalators and elevators.  The guards finally opened the fire escapes to let people out.",topic_17,-0.4053213,Negative

Turns out it's the same erosian the statue of liberty had (and what later renevotions honored).,topic_17,0.0599281,Neutral
It has an elevator that will take visitors to one platform. Not really the same experience though to just go up and down.,topic_17,-0.059928097,Neutral
"No, but that's a rude way to refer to people with disabilities, and there could have been creative ways to allow for different viewpoints and experiencing different landings. It's very much just ""ticking the box"" of being ADA compliant without actually allowing a broader range of people to have a meaningful experience. But if you ask me taking the stairs up isn't going to be a very interesting experience either, so I don't know if people who need the elevator will be missing out on much.....",topic_17,-0.65840906,Negative
Take a look at the photo. There are curved elevators.,topic_17,0.029991005,Neutral
That does NOT look ADA compliant.,topic_17,-0.7013741,Negative
Wouldn't they just have to have an elevator somewhere?,topic_17,-0.1586485,Neutral

I had one of those conversations you have when you're high with a friend and came up with a gang bang scenario where guys must come up the steps to meet the pornstar at the top by the elevator and on e the guy has his turn he may take the elevator down,topic_17,0.0,Neutral
In the context of this thread we are clearly talking about what’s publicly accessible. I even clarified in my 2nd reply to you.,topic_17,0.089757785,Neutral
"Also, ADA?",topic_17,0.019997334,Neutral
There will be an elevator.,topic_17,0.12927258,Neutral
I don't think they need an excuse or precedent to do this. I can't wait until I climb that thing. Should be an elevator in the core that takes you all the way up though. Maybe an inner layer of ADA ramps spiraling up? And that reflection on the facade of the far left building....super reach.,topic_17,0.26362482,Positive
"Plus, there's an elevator.",topic_17,0.4381993,Positive
"Lol it's a shitty design plain and simple. Everyone keeps saying ""there's an elevator"". That doesnt mean shit. Ride to the top, ride back down. It's not the same experience. The thing is stupid ass.",topic_17,-0.7305939,Negative
Sounds like there's an elevator.,topic_17,0.0099996645,Neutral

"Yeah, I believe it is a requirement because of ADA laws.",topic_17,0.17808086,Neutral

indeed = it's lame that people w disabilities need an elevator.,topic_17,-0.72589743,Negative
The elevator is reserved for disability use only,topic_17,-0.16838105,Neutral
"Yup! Was about to say that, I was there two weeks ago and me being lazy wanted to take the elevator but they said it is for disability only. The Vessel is quite a workout lol",topic_17,-0.019997345,Neutral
"The criticism is exactly that it's just stairs. It serves no purpose. It has no function or reason for being. It was just made for millionaires to flaunt their wealth. While technically publicly accessible, when you buy a ticket you waive all copywrites to any photos you take. The elevator, which is necessary for access by disabled people, is clearly tacked on as an afterthought. The surrounding development, built as part of the same complex, only serves the elite. It's a monument for the rich and regular people have been blessed to be given access to this small sliver of it. The whole Hudson Yards complex is fucking bullshit, and the Vessel is the epitome of it.",topic_17,-0.65270674,Negative
There is an elevator if you prefer to take that up and walk down. Shame that it's going to be closed due to the acts of a few people.,topic_17,-0.64692944,Negative
The elevator is for handicapped persons that want to take a photo on top. Otherwise I think you can't use it.,topic_17,-0.25429556,Negative
There’s an elevator fwiw,topic_17,0.03997868,Neutral
Beautiful. so glad there's an elevator.,topic_17,0.7487043,Positive
The elevator from the HY stop of the 7 is an INCLINED FUNICULAR. Goes pretty slow to deter unnecessary use but it’s a rare use of passenger elevators.,topic_17,0.03997867,Neutral
Wait is that like a rack and pinion going up the side of the elevator part to the right?,topic_17,0.019997334,Neutral

"You...do see the big elevator right in the middle, right?",topic_17,0.06988589,Neutral
"“Accessible” does not mean “wheelchairs can go everywhere in the place”. It means there are provisions for wheelchair access. Which there are. Because, like, it’s literally not possible for a brand new, multimillion dollar, high profile building to be non-ADA compliant, dawg.",topic_17,-0.14888504,Neutral
I just don’t understand the point of having an elevator not land on a full floor. Do people with wheelchairs just got to the level above then go down the stairs? Why have an elevator if you still have to use stairs?,topic_17,-0.55805224,Negative
"Beside ""Black"" and, well, ""White"".",topic_17,-0.0099996645,Neutral

I believe you pay to ride the elevator,topic_17,0.029991005,Neutral
Actually it is. It has an elevator that travels on a curved path and stops on each level.,topic_17,0.0599281,Neutral
"I believe they then got sued for making it inaccessible to wheelchair users. And so added an elevator, which still limits access to the short stretch of balconies serviced.",topic_17,-0.597982,Negative

"A CURVED elevator at that, also expensive",topic_17,-0.69625765,Negative
The whole thing is surprisingly accessible actually. The inclined elevator system is really cool and frankly just as interesting as the rest of the structure even if you can't explore all the levels.,topic_17,0.7530659,Positive
That was far more constructive than voting.,topic_17,0.46211714,Positive
They should add ramps to accommodate the suicidal paraplegics.,topic_17,-0.4462436,Negative
Is there a dude lying on the ground in the left hand side of pic (maybe 2nd from top?). Anyone else see that?,topic_17,-0.049958374,Neutral

Yes I’d love for it to be added to the game!,topic_17,0.7487043,Positive
As much as they can. When they added personality to Harlem in the Miles game it added so much. They should try to diversify and add cool stuff to the whole map. FiDi should feel different from West Village and so on.,topic_17,0.63514894,Positive
